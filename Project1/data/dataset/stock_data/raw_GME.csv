[MUSIC PLAYING] SEANA SMITH: We've got just around a minute here until the closing bell. We have Mark Luschini, the chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott. We also have Jimmy Lee, the Wealth Consulting Group's CEO. And Jared, taking a look at the market moves, you just had the Dow slipping back into positive territory here in the final couple of minutes. JARED BLIKRE: Yeah, 6 points, 5 points. You can see it on your screen, not a whole lot of action in the markets this week. But let's review the majors, down 82 basis, points that's 8/10 of a percent, for the Dow. And S&P 500 up a little bit today, up a little bit, even more over the week, about 4/10 of a percent. And then the NASDAQ, that has been the biggest gainer this week, up 1.8%. And we'll also throw in the Russell 2000, which is up the most today, up 1.93% itself but off those highs. And the week's price action driven, in large part, by the 10-year T note yield. This is a six-month look at the 10-year T note yield. And you can see that we dropped through this support line, 1.5%. And I'll tell you what. If it goes down much further, you're going to see more rotation into those growth stocks instead of the value and cyclical trade, guys. [MUSIC PLAYING] [BELL RINGS] SEANA SMITH: All right, that wraps up the trading week here. Again, looks like the Dow might hold on to slight gains. S&P closing up at a new record. The NASDAQ up just around 3/10 of a percent. You can see the NASDAQ adding 49 points as we shake out the final trade. Sector action here, financials, consumer discretionary, technology among the leaders. On the flip side, real estate and health care are the laggards. We want to bring in Jimmy Lee and Mark Luschini standing by here to help us break down the action that we've seen. And Jimmy, let's just start not only today but this week. We certainly saw a lot of action in some of those meme plays that have become the favorite here amongst retail investors. More broadly speaking, we got that stronger than expected CPI number yesterday. How are you looking at the week's movements?

2021-06-11T18:29:13.000Z,"AMC Party Trends on Twitter, Stock Inches Closer to USD 50
FX Empire","Meme stocks are on the comeback trail after giving retail investors a cause for worry this week. Shares of AMC Entertainment are up about 13% today following a rocky week in which the stock fell from its perch of USD 55 to below USD 50. Now it is racing toward the USD 50 threshold once again. Investors are shaking off the week with a Twitter campaign that is catching on called hashtag “AMC Party.” Their happy mood seems to be spilling over to the stock headed into the weekend, with shares of AMC seeing green along with its meme stock peers. In particular, the Reddit investor crowd seems to be focused on June 18 for call option expirations. In early June, traders reportedly poured more than USD 11 billion into AMC-related options contracts. One trader who goes by “MartyParty” on Twitter and who has amassed more than 21K followers said he “bought another AMC call option for June 18 USD 243.” The meme stock crowd has been growing lately with some new names. AMC remains one of the most promising, however, for the WallStreetBets crowd from which it got its fame. According to fintech company S3 Partners, the movie chain has boasted what’s known as a “squeeze score” of 10 out of 10. In fact, the firm revised its model from a range of 1-10 to a range of 1-100. Even with this wider scale, AMC alongside GameStop and Clover Health all score 100. By way of comparison, Tesla stock has a squeeze score of 23 out of 100. In dollar terms, AMC stock has short interest of USD 3.4 billion attached, according to S3 Partners’ Ihor Dusaniwsky. Individual investors are looking to put the squeeze on sophisticated traders like hedge funds. They have already been quite successful, costing hedge funds billions of dollars in losses this year in market rallies led by the likes of AMC and fellow meme stock leader GameStop. Now retail investors are hoping for a chance to amplify their gains further with a short squeeze at the traders’ expense. In this case, the traders, who are betting on the stock’s decline, would have to cover their short positions by buying shares of the stock. This is the Holy Grail for the WallStreetBets Reddit crowd.       ",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amc-party-trends-twitter-stock-182913633.html

2021-06-11T20:25:09.000Z,Zombie Stocks Defy Bankruptcy Logic as Meme Traders Bid Them Up,"(Bloomberg) -- It’s looking more and more like corporate-finance textbooks need a chapter on memes. Being on the brink of bankruptcy no longer seems to matter much in the U.S. stock market. While that might sound like the beginning of a cautionary tale about the state of investing in 2021, the reality is far stranger. Redditors have bid up shares of AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. and GameStop Corp. so much that it’s saved them -- for now, at least -- from deep trouble. They’re not the only troubled companies where social-media users are trying to conjure magic. In a broad benchmark of U.S. stocks known as the Russell 3000 Index, there are 726 companies whose earnings don’t cover their interest payments, a red flag to pros, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. These zombies are up an average of 30% in 2021 -- trouncing the 13% return for the whole index -- and 41 of them have doubled since New Year’s Eve. Even explicitly dire warnings don’t seem to register. A bankruptcy plan under consideration by GTT Communications Inc. would wipe out shareholders, which is typical in Chapter 11 cases, Bloomberg reported May 24. Nevertheless, the company’s stock is up about 69% since then. Wall Street is starting to factor in the impact of traders drumming up enthusiasm for stocks on social media and Reddit threads. Theater operator AMC, which was on the brink of bankruptcy last year, now has a “path to a sustainable capital structure,” according to S&P Global Ratings, in part because it’s been able to sell new shares amid huge demand from retail investors. Video-game retailer GameStop is now debt-free for the same reason. “When looking at the debt of certain issuers, it’s becoming difficult not to take into account equity valuations that may seem inflated by Reddit-driven trading, especially as companies such as AMC are able to monetize these valuations,” said Ben Briggs, a credit analyst at StoneX Financial Inc. In bankruptcy, shareholders are the last to recover value, only after all debt holders are paid. Still, investors are piling into shares of troubled names -- and even companies already in bankruptcy proceedings. Medley Management Inc. has soared this month. The firm’s private-debt business filed for Chapter 11 protection in March with plans to repay its debt with new stock.

2021-06-11T17:41:00.000Z,"If GameStop has your kids interested in investing, here's what to do
MoneyWise","The rise of meme stocks — shares in GameStop, AMC and a handful of other companies whose value has been driven through the roof thanks to the coordinated efforts of everyday investors — has been a mixed blessing. While they have shown just how easily the stock market can be manipulated, meme stocks have also made a lot of people a lot of money — in the short-term, anyway. But the meme stock phenomenon could have at least one long-lasting benefit: an increased interest in investing among American teenagers. A recent Wells Fargo survey found that 45% of teens are more interested in investing this year because of the wide-ranging attention GameStop has received since the company’s stock price exploded from $65.01 on Jan.22 to $347.51 on Jan. 27. You might have reservations about your children learning about investing through social media platforms like Reddit, but an early interest in financial literacy, no matter where it comes from, will serve them well throughout their lives. Here’s how you can help them build on what they've already learned online. When asked where they get their information about finances, 57% of Wells Fargo’s teenage survey respondents said they learn about dollars and cents from their parents. But other sources of information, like school (47%), social media (35%) and online websites and articles (34%) are all having an influence. They’re also having more of an influence than parents are aware of. Only 12% of the parents surveyed for the study believe their kids use social media for their financial education. “There is a bit of a disconnection between parents’ and kids’ perceptions around financial education,” said Kathleen Malone, financial adviser with Wells Fargo Advisors in Charlotte, North Carolina. “It’s very important for families to discuss money — and for our next generation to understand how to handle their finances.” Assessing just how complete that understanding is is a little difficult. While 69% of teenagers said they are good with money, 49% would give their investment knowledge a grade of D or F. But there was consensus in one key area: 93% of teens agree that learning about investing now will help them be more financially stable in the future.

2021-06-11T17:15:48.000Z,Meme stock CEOs should just be honest and transparent: former Cisco CEO,"John Chambers has pretty much seen, and done it all in corporate America.  Chambers led Cisco for two decades, surviving the dot com crash and going onto build the company into the tech powerhouse it is today through numerous acquisitions and impressive operational skill. Along the way he developed close, lasting relationships with world leaders such as France President Emmanuel Macron.  Since leaving as Cisco's chairman in December 2017, Chambers has led his own venture capital firm (backed by his own money) called JC 2 Ventures. JC 2 invests in early stage companies ranging from a drone maker to a food company that sells cricket-based snacks. So with that extensive resume as a backdrop, Yahoo Finance Live asked Chambers his thoughts on CEOs managing through the current meme stock movement sweeping the markets. To be sure, how CEOs of meme companies have reacted varies wildly.  On the one hand you have AMC Entertainment CEO Adam Aron, who has taken the frenzy in his stock to raise large chunks of cash and give interviews to YouTube stars. The other end of the spectrum is Bed Bath & Beyond CEO Mark Tritton, who has preferred to remain focused on his turnaround plan and the future fundamentals of the business.  Here is Chambers' take on the present frenzied moment from an excerpt of his interview on Yahoo Finance Live (full interview above). It has been edited for length and clarity. Yahoo Finance: You have done just about everything in corporate America, what would you do if you were the CEO or on the board of one of these meme stock companies? Chambers: I think many of us have learned from the past, so let me be critical of myself. In 2000 after we had the dot com bubble and the market kept going up, my lesson learned is you have to say at a point in time this is moving beyond what is justifiable. And it's important for my shareholders to know that although I am happy when the stock goes up, it doesn't justify this type of numbers.

Because you get your chief information security officer up in front of the court. They show the data. And your board looks at you, and they say, can you prevent this? And can you recover? And you're really betting on the CSO being able to do that for you. You're going to see a host of new startups that your investors might be in coming at this marketplace. A company like [?

2021-06-11T17:00:53.000Z,Here are the 5 stocks Reddit’s WallStreetBets are talking about today,"Friday is, after an exhausting week, a fairly slow day for meme stocks. None of the Reddit favorites are on a tear—in either direction—but history has shown that those breath-catching periods don’t tend to last for long. One way to try to read the r/WallStreetBets tea leaves is to judge which companies are getting the most chatter. A surge in threads about Blackberry and Clover Health Investments this week, for instance, saw both companies post notable gains. (Although, it should be noted, both gave up those gains by the end of the week.) So what are the AMC apes, GameStop gorillas, and other HODLers talking about today? Here are the five most mentioned tickers, courtesy of real-time reddit ticker analytics site YoloStocks. AMC (AMC): Some apes are licking their wounds after the theater chain’s stock dropped from nearly $60 on Tuesday to less than $44 today. But they’re still talking. AMC makes up 11% of the conversations in the past 24 hours. GameStop (GME): The original meme stock is still going strong, but some investors took a beating this week after it dropped from $337 on Tuesday to under $214 today after the company said it’s being investigated by the SEC. GameStop shares, though, have ridden this sort of roller coaster several times in the past month. And investors are still talking it up, dominating 10% of the chatter. Blackberry (BB): One of the quieter meme stocks, Blackberry jumps from sixth to third among discussions, also occupying 10% of the conversations. Whether that signals another surge of interest in the coming days, though, is still unknown. ContextLogic (WISH): The e-commerce platform that operates at Wish.com specializes in dirt-cheap products, and the stock hasn’t been a barn burner for much of this year either. But it has caught the eye of Reddit and currently makes up 6% of the mentions on r/WallStreetBets. Cleveland-Cliffs (CLF): This Ohio-based company, which mines iron ore and produces flat-rolled steel, has been the focus of 5% of the subreddit’s mentions. Clover Health, incidentally, which exploded on Wednesday, has fallen to the eighth most mentioned stock, with 4% of the mentions.

2021-06-11T16:28:23.000Z,WallStreetBets founder: Meme stock trading isn't market manipulation,"The man that lit the fire for the current meme stock movement sweeping markets for the second time this year said the recent trading frenzy isn't market manipulation.  It's just good old fashioned buying and selling in a market for a stock.  ""I mean what is market manipulation? You have people that are buying and you have people that are selling, right? If you have a fraudulent intent — if somebody goes up there and lies and says oh, BlackBerry has this new hologram cellphone that does whatever and it's a lie, that is market manipulation. And that's fraud,"" WallStreetBets founder Jaime Rogozinski said on Yahoo Finance Live. ""But people coming together and saying let's just push this price to the moon and being really transparent and no defrauding taking place, that is absolutely what the market is."" Rogozinski founded the popular Reddit trading forum WallStreetBets in 2012. At the time, Rogozinski was single and looking for a more active way to trade investment ideas inside a community. Enter WallStreetBets.  While Rogozinski is no longer affiliated with WallStreetBets (the platform was becoming a bit too rowdy for his liking), to say his influence lives on in the trading world is an understatement.  WallStreetBets has become the digital trading desk of choice among a new generation of investors who are aggressively pushing up shares of struggling companies such as AMC, GameStop and BlackBerry.  And this group with its own eclectic language not unlike that found on Wall Street trading floors continues to cash in on its growing influence.  AMC shares are up more than 2,000% this year, despite the company selling shares several times (which would normally lead to a sell-off) to capitalize. GameStop's stock has surged more than 1,000% on the year as traders firmly believe new chairman and former Chewy founder Ryan Cohen could transform the company.

2021-06-11T12:36:39.000Z,"Retail investor base doubles in Europe as U.S. ""meme"" stock mania spreads - Euronext
Reuters","By Saikat Chatterjee LONDON (Reuters) - The number of retail investors in Europe has doubled since the start of last year as stay-at-home rules and high savings rates during the pandemic triggered a surge in stock investing by non-professionals, according to data from Euronext. The trend is still less prevalent in Europe than in the United States, where retail investor participation in stock markets soared last summer before hitting extreme levels in January. So-called meme stocks like U.S. video-retailer Gamestop Corp and AMC Entertainment Holdings saw record inflows fuelled by retail investors sharing investment strategies on social media. Trading in Europe is more fragmented given the number of different stock exchanges in the region. Still, the share of total trading carried out by retail investors jumped to nearly 7% by mid-2020 from 2% in 2019, before settling at around 5% currently, Euronext said. By comparison, Jefferies analyst Daniel Fannon estimated in January that retail can represent up to 32% of total U.S. equity volume. Meanwhile, the number of retail investors has doubled over the past 18 months on Euronext, the exchange's CEO Stephane Boujnah told Reuters. Following its purchase of Borsa Italiana last year, Euronext controls a quarter of the equity trading flow in Europe with exchanges in Paris, Amsterdam, Lisbon and Dublin, according to analysts. Boujnah said market abuse regulations in Europe are much stricter than in the U.S., making it difficult for retail investors to combine forces and defeat the short selling strategy of some funds, a key driver of the ""U.S. meme stock phenomenon"". Retail investors have also flocked to easy-to-use share trading platforms such as etoro, which signed up 3.1 million new registered users in the first quarter of 2021, compared to 5.2 million through all of 2020. In the U.S., the trend accelerated after large brokers like Schwab and Fidelity dropped their trading commissions, following startups like Robinhood and Social Finance Inc.

2021-06-11T15:31:48.000Z,Yahoo! U presents: The basics of equity offerings,"Myles Udland joins Brian Cheung for a special edition of Yahoo! U to explain the basics of an equity offering to the Yahoo Finance Live audience. MYLES UDLAND: And something that has come up as we have seen a number of these stocks go significantly higher in price is the pressure it does or does not put on corporate management to issue additional shares. Brian Cheung joins us now for a special edition of Yahoo U exploring the world of stock issuance. BRIAN CHEUNG: Well, class is in session. And today, we are talking about stock issuance. So if Yahoo U 101 is all about IPOs, that means Yahoo 201 might be about secondary issuance or stock issuance after a company is already public. And we saw that this became an issue with AMC when we were talking about obviously the new stock that it had authorized in April but actually sold last week. So let's explain the pros and cons of issuing new stock if you are using a theoretical company. And wait a minute, is that Yahoo Finance's Myles Udland over there? I mean, it turns out he has a shoe company and it's public already. Now, he's got a million shares outstanding, right, and he wants to raise more capital to, let's say, expand his summer barbecue sneaker line. So he's going to try and sell a hundred thousand new shares. Now, these two shareholders in Myles' Shoes-- let's call them Julie and Brian here-- they're not necessarily happy with this decision because when a company issues more shares, that's going to increase the number of stakes in a pie that's still the same size. So if the new shares also have voting power, one effect of this is going to be that Brian and Julie will have less voting power because their portion of the overall outstanding shares got smaller. Now, the bigger deal is that second bullet point there, right? The earnings from Myles' Shoes are now divided up among more shares, which means that Brian and Julie are entitled to fewer earnings in the company since they have to share it now with more people. And this, by the way, is called dilution, like when you water down a drink. Now, for Myles this may be the cost of doing business. So let's say this is where shares of Myles' Shoes have been trading over the last six months or so.          ",https://finance.yahoo.com/video/yahoo-u-presents-basics-equity-153148796.html

Yahoo Finance Video","Yahoo Finance's Jared Blikre joined Yahoo Finance Live to break down Chewy's latest earnings. SEANA SMITH: We want to get to some breaking news. Chewy is out with its earnings report. The stock under a little bit of pressure. Jared Blikre has that for us. Jared. JARED BLIKRE: Yeah, that's right. Stock's down about 2%, 3% in after-hours trading. I'll tell you what, the numbers are not bad. But the topline number for net sales, that came in just in line with Wall Street expectations at 2.14 billion. So maybe TheStreet was expecting a blowout in order to get the stock higher. But we still have the call at 5:00 PM. Here's some of the other numbers. They managed a profit when TheStreet was expecting a loss of $11.7 million. Their-- excuse me, their net profit for the first quarter came in at $38.7 million, so a nice beat there. But they're also giving their projections for the second quarter and the full year. And the revenue numbers, they bumped up a little bit, but not a lot. So for the current quarter, 2.15 to 2.17 billion. And then for the full year, 8.9 to 9 billion. And again, those numbers were just a little bit lower from the former forecast. Now also looking at gross margin, 27%-- 27.6%, that expanded 420 basis points year-over-year. Net margin of 1.8% improved 480 basis points year-over-year. And then a quick comment from the CEO. ""2021 is already turning out to be an exciting and busy year for Chewy. We continue to execute against our growth roadmap, expand our customer base, increase share of wallet, and grow our addressable market expanding verticals.""

And bring in Chad Beynon, who covers the stock over at Macquarie. Chad, it's a tough job, but somebody's got to do it, I guess. You've got a neutral rating on the stock. You've got a $6 price target. And you basically say, no theater stock has ever traded at this kind of a valuation. So what do you do from a valuation perspective and trying to crunch the numbers on something like this? CHAD BEYNON: Thanks, Julie. Thanks for having me. You know, I'd say we're continuously improving our process in terms of, you know, how we're recommending our stock valuations to institutional holders. We've been looking at, you know, some of the option trading, some of the volume, some of the correlations with other meme stocks in the past couple weeks. And, you know, this stock that went from mid teens up to $60 has kind of reverted back to $45. So we're not going to continuously update our price target, you know, every week or every couple days. Obviously, there were a few important fundamental characteristics that came out last week with the equity raises. But we're still analyzing. We're still improving our due diligence. As you mentioned, fundamentally things are getting better. But we're still not back to where movie theater attendance was back in 2019. BRIAN SOZZI: Chad, we just talked with a hard core believer in a GameStop. Really couldn't articulate what the fundamentals of the company are. Didn't really have a well defined vision for what GameStop will be five years from now. As an analyst who crunches the numbers and talks to sources and contacts, what do you think about that?

The US Open taking place a couple of months from now, and apparently, Mr. Sozzi is going to try his hand at being a ballboy. Take a look. BRIAN SOZZI: I escaped my apartment for the first time in a long time during work hours and ended up in Flushing Meadows, the home of the US Open. Before I was put to the ultimate test, I gathered a lot of advice on what makes a good ballperson on this grand sporting stage. Sal Chan has been a ballperson at the US Open since 1998. SAL CHAN: They're quick, they're agile, they pay attention to everything that's going on on court, and they're not noticed at all by anyone.

CHARLOTTE GOLDBAUM: I definitely start by going on runs every day, making sure I'm staying fit, trying to get some biking in, to practicing sprints beforehand. Yeah, just keeping up that stamina. BRIAN SOZZI: I have spent 18 months reporting on meme stocks for Yahoo Finance inside my kitchen. But, but, I have been training hard, training hard to be a ballperson at this year's 2021 US Open.

This was a cryptocurrency that was created as a joke, based on that doge, the cute shiba inu meme. MYLES UDLAND: Reddit is saying, hey, just because you guys have CFAs, and wear vests, and go to an office in midtown doesn't mean that you're the only ones who can understand what's happening. BRIAN SOZZI: I'm the voice of reason. The fundamentals are just-- in no way on some of these companies justify these valuations. It may not be tomorrow. But rest assured, it will absolutely end very badly for the traders trading these stocks. JULIE HYMAN: Getting reports this morning from people who use Robinhood, in particular, that basically it's not allowing people to put on new positions. - A relatively small number of stocks have gone viral. And we have to have a prudent risk management. And that's what the firm did. JARED BLIKRE: And even though this is a financial services committee, there are very few people on that panel who are going to truly understand what's going on. KEITH GILL: I'm not a cat. I'm just an individual who's investment in GameStop and posts on social media were based upon my own research. MYLES UDLAND: I mean, Sozzi, are we ever going to be at a point in our lives when we don't check in on GME every so often? BRIAN SOZZI: No, it's a trade that we just can't-- we can't shake. [MUSIC PLAYING] MYLES UDLAND: And five months later, we are still talking about GME, AMC, and all of the names, of course, that have been a part of the meme trade over the last several months.

Cohen wanted the message to be stern, said the sources, who were close to the discussions. The transformation of the ailing brick-and-mortar retailer into an e-commerce powerhouse would require laser-like focus and determination, Cohen told Furlong.    The role would come with no frills, but it would pay off handsomely in GameStop shares if the turnaround was successful. The majority of Furlong's performance-based compensation will be tied to stock awards.    The move represents Cohen's boldest gambit yet in his push to attract talent from Amazon. GameStop's market value has soared to $16 billion from $250 million a year ago, as amateur traders challenged hedge funds betting against the company and turned it into a popular ""meme"" stock on Reddit and other social media.    Most analysts say the valuation of the company is out of whack with the fundamentals of its business, representing a bold bet for any GameStop recruit who accepts the volatile stock as part of their compensation.    GameStop on Wednesday announced the hiring of Furlong alongside that of Amazon's North American consumer business financial chief Mike Recupero as its chief financial officer. They were the latest Amazon veterans poached by Cohen, the billionaire co-founder of online pet supplies retailer Chewy Inc , who joined GameStop's board in January.    In March, Cohen tapped Amazon operations executive Jenna Owens as chief operating officer, one month after bringing in top Amazon Web Services engineer Matt Francis as chief technology officer.

Revenue rose 25.1% year-over-year to $1.3 billion and beat consensus estimates of $1.2 billion. Management noted that sales increased even though the company operated fewer stores in the quarter. GameStop stores continued to be closed across Europe because of the COVID-19 pandemic. The adjusted loss of $0.45 per share improved from a loss of $2.44 per share a year ago and beat consensus expectations for a loss of $0.83 per share. GameStop did not provide guidance for the second quarter but said it continues to see momentum in sales trends. Total sales in May jumped 27% compared to the same period last year. Alongside the quarterly results, the company said it may sell up to 5 million shares to raise money to invest in growth initiatives and keep its balance sheet strong. Shares fell around 27% on Thursday on concerns by shareholders over the potential dilution of their holdings. GameStop finished Q1 with cash and restricted cash of $770.8 million and no long-term debt. (See GameStop stock analysis on TipRanks) Additionally, GameStop announced the appointment of former Amazon executives Matt Furlong and Mike Recupero as CEO and CFO, respectively. “The Company is continuing to actively pursue senior talent with gaming, retail and technology experience,” GameStop said in a press release.

2021-06-11T20:25:09.000Z,"Zombie Stocks Defy Bankruptcy Logic as Meme Traders Bid Them Up
Bloomberg","(Bloomberg) -- It’s looking more and more like corporate-finance textbooks need a chapter on memes. Being on the brink of bankruptcy no longer seems to matter much in the U.S. stock market. While that might sound like the beginning of a cautionary tale about the state of investing in 2021, the reality is far stranger. Redditors have bid up shares of AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. and GameStop Corp. so much that it’s saved them -- for now, at least -- from deep trouble. They’re not the only troubled companies where social-media users are trying to conjure magic. In a broad benchmark of U.S. stocks known as the Russell 3000 Index, there are 726 companies whose earnings don’t cover their interest payments, a red flag to pros, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. These zombies are up an average of 30% in 2021 -- trouncing the 13% return for the whole index -- and 41 of them have doubled since New Year’s Eve. Even explicitly dire warnings don’t seem to register. A bankruptcy plan under consideration by GTT Communications Inc. would wipe out shareholders, which is typical in Chapter 11 cases, Bloomberg reported May 24. Nevertheless, the company’s stock is up about 69% since then. Wall Street is starting to factor in the impact of traders drumming up enthusiasm for stocks on social media and Reddit threads. Theater operator AMC, which was on the brink of bankruptcy last year, now has a “path to a sustainable capital structure,” according to S&P Global Ratings, in part because it’s been able to sell new shares amid huge demand from retail investors. Video-game retailer GameStop is now debt-free for the same reason. “When looking at the debt of certain issuers, it’s becoming difficult not to take into account equity valuations that may seem inflated by Reddit-driven trading, especially as companies such as AMC are able to monetize these valuations,” said Ben Briggs, a credit analyst at StoneX Financial Inc. In bankruptcy, shareholders are the last to recover value, only after all debt holders are paid. Still, investors are piling into shares of troubled names -- and even companies already in bankruptcy proceedings. Medley Management Inc. has soared this month. The firm’s private-debt business filed for Chapter 11 protection in March with plans to repay its debt with new stock.

2021-06-10T20:47:55.000Z,Tech Giants Lift S&P 500 to Record as Reddit Favorites Languish,"(Bloomberg) -- For all the hubbub around meme stocks in recent weeks, it was on a day that the day-trader favorites plunged that the S&P 500 Index climbed to its first record close since early May. Tech shares climbed 0.8%, led by stalwarts Amazon.com Inc., propelling the benchmark for American equities to an all-time high of 4,239.18 GameStop Corp. plunged 27% and AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. sank 13%, dragging a Goldman Sachs Group Inc. basket of meme stocks to a 6% loss on Thursday. For months, the broad market was stuck in a limited range as day traders flocked to shares with elevated short interests to profit from short-squeezed rallies. That split performance reversed Thursday as investors brushed aside stronger-than-expected inflation data and bet that the Federal Reserve will maintain its ultra-accommodative policies. Meanwhile, GameStop led the retreat in retail favorites after the company said it planned to sell more shares and offered few details about its turnaround strategy. “The market is higher today because huge parts of the market like big tech are getting some reprieve from lower rates while more economically sensitive equities are still getting support,” Tallbacken Capital Advisors’ Michael Purves said. “It’s largely a win-win day for the broader market, and if AMC and GME are down a lot, it is really a sideshow.” Seven of the S&P 500’s 11 major industries advanced, driving the benchmark above the previous record notched in early May. The tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 jumped 1.1% to the highest level since April. By contrast, day-traders darlings fell back to Earth.

2021-06-10T20:05:44.000Z,GameStop Tumbles on Stock Sale Plan and Unclear Strategy View,"(Bloomberg) -- GameStop Corp.’s meteoric rally this year as one of the first meme-stock icons may be losing steam after the company said it planned to sell more shares and offered few details about its turnaround strategy. The Grapevine, Texas-based video-game retailer fell 27% to $220.39 on Thursday in the biggest drop since March 24. The stock, which was among the first to get a huge Reddit and social media following earlier this year, has surged about 1,100% in 2021 as retail investors banded together to take on short sellers and amid optimism on a corporate turnaround. With the stock about 50% from its intraday record high of $483, investors are still waiting for a clear strategy from newly appointed chairman and activist investor Ryan Cohen. GameStop did announce a pair of new leaders from Amazon.com Inc. to help with turning the brick-and-mortar chain into an e-commerce powerhouse. “Investors deserve more than memes to value a company’s fundamental, long-term prospects,” Baird analyst Colin Sebastian wrote in a note. While clearly laying out the groundwork for digital transformation, the board is not ready to disclose details on some challenges, he said. News that GameStop may offer another 5 million shares and that past trading activity is being investigated by the Securities and Exchange Commission is also weighing on its stock. “The trading probe is definitely a big red flag,” David Trainer, chief executive officer of investment research firm New Constructs, said in an interview. It may be “the needle that can bust the balloon of the stock’s valuation.” For Wedbush analyst Michael Pachter, the outcome of the probe is unclear and investors may have been more disappointed with the planned share offering. The shelf registration “may have had something to do with” decline following results, Pachter wrote in a note Thursday. Still, he views the potential stock sale as a positive for the company as it would provide more dry powder for acquisitions.

JARED BLIKRE: And for that, we're going to bring in Jacob Frenkel. He's the Dickson Wright Government Investigations and Securities Enforcement Practice Chair. That's quite a title you have there. I know you used to work for the SEC in the division of enforcement, as well as prosecuting criminals as a prosecutor. So I'm just wondering, it seems to me, and we talk to a guest in the last hour about this, they might be targeting individuals who were trading on inside information. But hardly, to me, does it seem like this is something that's prevalent in the C-suite. What's your analysis of this situation? JACOB FRENKEL: This is not an investigation of GameStop itself, any of GameStop's disclosures. GameStop pretty much made that clear in its 10-Q that it filed yesterday. I mean, so without question, this is about those who are participating in the trading. And the presumption is-- the SEC is looking at not only the longside-- potential longside manipulation, also short side. It could be individuals. It could be institutions. You know, the-- that's not information that GameStop would know, or even if it did, that it would necessarily be disclosing. On the other hand, at least we now know that the SEC is actually probing something we've sort of been wondering about since January. AKIKO FUJITA: Yeah, Jacob, I'm going to have you grab water there, hopefully. But you know, we had a conversation at the height of the GameStop trade back in January, and I remember we were talking about a potential investigation here. Now we know, to your point, that the SEC is looking into this. What kind of timeline do you think we're looking at right now, and what does that suggest, in terms of how the SEC plans to go about this investigation? JACOB FRENKEL: Akiko, great question. Because when we have phenomenal like we were talking about back in January, back when I was advocating that the SEC should have actually imposed a trading suspension, there is-- you know, when you're talking about a market that appears to be out of control, you know, out of line with-- you know, with fundamentals, the expectation is the SEC is going to move very quickly. This investigation is going to take well over a year. In fact, the SEC about three weeks ago brought a case involving short sellers where the conduct occurred four years before bringing the case.

But for investors, that new direction is as yet unclear. Shares of GameStop sank by 27% on Thursday, logging their worst day since March even after the company reported first-quarter results that topped estimates. Sales grew by a better-than-expected 25% to $1.28 billion, while adjusted losses narrowed to 45 cents per share, compared to losses of $1.61 per share during the same period last year.  The release coincided with the company's announcements that it appointed a new chief executive officer and chief financial officer, planned to sell more shares and was being investigated by the U.S. Security and Exchange Commission over trading activity. Earlier Wednesday, GameStop shareholders also voted Ryan Cohen, co-founder of the e-commerce platform Chewy (CHWY), as chairman of the board.  But amid the flurry of updates, GameStop left a glaring omission — namely, its plan to transform the company into a formidable retail competitor, according to at least one Wall Street analyst.  ""We don't know where GameStop is headed but it's clear that they intend to remake themselves as an Amazon-lite,"" Wedbush analyst Michael Pachter told Yahoo Finance on Thursday. ""And Ryan Cohen promised investors a strategy back in mid-January. It's been nearly five months and we haven't seen that yet."" ""I think the pullback in the stock is, investors are getting tired of waiting for him to tell us what the strategy is. I'm getting tired waiting,"" he added. ""And there's no chance I'm taking my target up unless he shows me the path to massive profit growth. I just don't see it."" Pachter has an Underperform recommendation on shares of GameStop with a $50 12-month price target, representing downside of 83% from its closing prices on Wednesday. In a note following earnings results, Pachter said the company ""was positioned to be a primary beneficiary of the new console launches,"" but that recent social media-fueled trading ""spiked the share price to levels that are completely disconnected from the fundamentals of the business.""

2021-06-10T16:45:48.000Z,Wage inflation could be with us for some time: Analyst,"Brandon Pizzurro, GuideStone Capital Management Director of Public Investments joins the Yahoo Finance Live panel to discuss the latest market news. - This is Brandon Pizzurro, GuideStone Capital Management Director of Public Investments. You were just listening to Brian kind of break down the numbers. What's your reaction here? BRANDON PIZZURRO: Yeah, good morning. Thanks for having me. So absolutely, inflation is the talk of the town this morning. I'm sure plenty of your guests have touched on it thus far. One of the things I think you need to think about in the inflation debate is really what part of that is reflation, so some of those things like car rentals and airfare versus actually inflation? We're of the mindset that some of this inflation is going to be stickier. You know, if you had a word cloud of all the inflation discussions you've had over the last couple of months, transitory, of course, would be the one right there in the middle. And we believe that while some of it is transitory, some of that reflation, some of this actual inflation seems to be more structural and potentially long-term. For example, do you think you're going to go to your average retail department store and find that they're rolling back prices or that you're going to go to your restaurant and they're going to be reducing prices six months from now? More than likely not. They're going to have to keep those margins up because obviously, there's also margin pressure from wage inflation. So a couple of things to think about there. But like you said earlier, markets don't seem to be overreacting to the news today. - On the issue of wage inflation though, it does feel like this is something that could be with us for some time, especially given the conversations that we've had with a lot of businesses who say, look, we're having to pay more to hire. We're holding off on raising prices right now but it's inevitable down the line. How are you looking at that specific factor in the larger context of inflation?

Yahoo Finance Video","Pete Thamel, Yahoo Sports Reporter joins the Yahoo Finance Live panel to discuss the latest in college sports. JARED BLIKRE: Welcome back to Yahoo Finance. I'm Jared Blikre. And it is now time to follow the money. And for this, we're going to be talking about college football playoff, so we're going to bring in our colleague here, Pete Thamel of Yahoo Sports. So we were just chatting over the break. The face of college, the end of the season has changed quite a bit from the old BCS days. Why don't you walk us through it? PETE THAMEL: Sure. So yesterday, Jared, a formal recommendation by a cabinet of college athletics officials who spent two years studying the postseason-- we're now 7 years through a 12-year contract with the current four-team college football playoffs-- and the recommendation that'll be studied at a series of meetings over the next couple of weeks is that this will become a 12-team playoff. So obviously, it is going to triple in size. And how we got here is a really good example of the politics internally that drive college sports. The conventional thought was four would go to eight. But the problem with eight was that there are now four at-large bids, the four teams that get chosen by the college football playoff committee. If they went to eight, there would be a necessity or a preference by a majority for automatic qualifiers. Well the high end leagues, including the SCC, saw all of a sudden the four at-large bids shrinking. So there would be five or even six aqS in two or only three at-large bids. And the SCC saw that as a way to diminish its chances to have a champion. So wanting everyone involved, wanting the so-called group of five, the other five leagues, to have a chance at a bid, and wanting the Pac-12, which has been shut out of the playoff in numerous occasions to have a chance, the compromise was to actually grow. Usually compromises you meet in the middle. In college athletics, they grew, and they came up with 12.         ",https://finance.yahoo.com/video/politics-behind-college-sports-171203469.html

Traders dismissed inflation data that came in above expectations to drive stocks higher on Thursday. It was the data everyone had been eyeing this week. The Labor Department said on Thursday its consumer price index rose 0.6% last month after edging up 0.9% in April. The uptick in consumer prices in May lifted the year-on-year increase in the CPI to 5% from 4.2% in April, the highest rate since the 1980s. Investors are going with the Fed's position that it's a passing phase. Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) appears to be running out of supplies, like so many industries (chips!) out there (are we sure about that transitory inflation, Fed?), The New York Times reported. GameStop Corp (NYSE:GME) continued to do its meme thing, dropping 25% after saying it will sell yet millions more in shares, taking full advantage of retail investors. Here's to another slow summer close to the week. Have a good one, people. Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow: 1. Let's chat Leaders from the G-7 nations start their meeting in Cornwall, England. President Joe Biden is making his first trip to the U.K. during his administration. He and his counterparts are expected to discuss the economic rebound from the pandemic. 2. Feeling sentimental After today's highly-anticipated inflation numbers, Friday's economic data release is the decidedly less sexy University of Michigan consumer sentiment reading. The initial June print is expected to come in at 84.2, a slight bump from the prior 82.9. The number will be released at 10:00 AM ET (1400 GMT). 3. Another record? U.S. stocks will look to close out the week on another high note. Investors shrugged off the latest signs of inflation to send the S&P 500 to a fresh record and the Nasdaq was near its April highs on Thursday.

2021-06-10T15:41:33.000Z,Why GameStop Stock Is Down By 13% Today,"GameStop Video 10.06.21. Shares of GameStop gained downside momentum after the company released its quarterly results. GameStop reported an adjusted loss of $0.45 per share and revenue of $1.28 billion, easily beating analyst estimates on both earnings and revenue. GameStop noted that it had $770.8 million of cash and restricted cash on May 1, 2021, while it had not borrowings under the asset-based revolving credit facility and no long-term debt. GameStop also stated that it may offer and sell up to 5 million shares of its common stock in “at-the-market” offerings. The company has also announced that Matt Furlong will become CEO while Mike Recupero will become CFO. Both executives come from Amazon. GameStop added that its May total sales increased by about 27% compared to last year, but the company continued to suspend guidance for the full year. While the company’s report exceeded analyst expectations, the news about another share sale served as a bearish catalyst for GameStop shares. The company’s management is using the stock’s popularity to boost GameStop’s balance sheet, which is the right thing to do from the business point of view. However, the “at-the-market” share sale may put pressure on GameStop shares as trading volume has declined significantly in recent months compared to January – March period. From the fundamental point of view, the stock remains significantly overvalued despite the positive trends highlighted by the report. In this light, the near-term dynamics of the stock depend on the activity of retail traders. It remains to be seen whether the current pullback will turn into a strong sell-off as professional short-sellers will likely stay away from GameStop after three major short squeezes in 2021. Without selling pressure from professionals, GameStop’s fate will be in the hands of retail traders which were not worried about the company’s fundamentals before, and may continue to hold GameStop stock.

Possibly the Reddit Raiders-- you know, the retail investors-- wanted to see somebody from Coinbase or somebody from some cannabis supplier-- something transformational-- take over as CEO. And we got more of the same. And as a fundamental research analyst, I am A-OK with hiring people from Amazon, especially from the e-commerce division. So these are good people. They're going to be competent executives. I'm not so sure that the departing executives were incompetent. You know, they managed to turn the company around, get it back to revenue growth.

I think our clients are looking at their portfolios and wondering how to pivot for the next 6 months, 12 months, 18 months. And inflation continues to be on top of mind for everyone. They're concerned that things are going to get more expensive. They're going to the supermarket, and they're seeing prices of things that they normally buy start to creep up. So that's concerning. And certainly what we're talking about now is, how do we get them to stay invested, look towards your long term financial goals, and obviously, keep up with, not only inflation, but also the importance of reaching those financial goals. So they're not keeping too much in cash. They're not keeping too much in fixed income if they have time on their hands. I think that's key. - Winnie, to those folks who see this inflation print and they get worried about the returns in their portfolio, and if they think that maybe the one way they can beat it is by just going all in on meme stocks, going out there and becoming more of an active trader, going all in on a GameStop, an AMC.

So let's start there. What have you seen in terms of interest growth and what specifically companies are looking at right now compared to before the pandemic? ONI BLACKSTOCK: Yes. Thank you so much for having me. The pandemic has really helped to bring to light and also amplify a number of health inequities that really existed even before the pandemic and now really are in a place where we need to actually do something about them. So we see many companies, particularly in the health care space, bringing in consultants, for instance, or creating positions for diversity, equity, inclusion chairs to begin this work in earnest in terms of figuring out how they can revamp their policies, their practices, their organizational culture to help advance equity and reduce many of the health disparities that we see.

And we've seen that over the years, research pointing to things like comfortable housing, access to nutritious food, as well as other items, including access to a job, access to the internet, things that are now coming up on the federal level is taking a hard look at that. Nothing more in terms of policy changes just yet, but we are, at the state level, unfortunately, seeing policy that's negatively affecting the LGBTQ community.

The company was able to achieve significant top-line growth, while the bottom line loss contracted on a year-over-year basis. Notably, the company witnessed sales growth across all categories.

Management remains impressed with growth witnessed in the quarter, despite store closures that were undertaken as part of the company’s de-densification efforts. Also, temporary store closures in Europe due to pandemic were a drag. Progressing on its growth endeavors, the company has been on track with strengthening balance sheet. This includes noteworthy steps undertaken to eliminate long term debt. Also, the company intends to sell more shares under its “at-the-market” equity offering program (the “ATM Offering”) for bolstering financial position as well as aiding business transformation. Further, the company announced new inclusions to its board.

Moving on, management highlighted that second-quarter sales trend continue to reflect growth. Total sales in May increased nearly 27% year on year. However, the company continues to suspend the guidance for the fiscal year.

We note that shares of the company dropped 5.2% during the after-market trading hours on June 9. GameStop posted adjusted loss of 45 cents per share, which was narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 67 cents. In the year-ago quarter, the company reported adjusted loss of $2.44.

Net sales amounted to $1,276.8 million, which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,176 million and increased 25% on a year-over-year basis. Prudent efforts to boost digital business capabilities as well as product offerings contributed to the company’s performance in the quarter. Markedly, it was able to achieve top-line growth despite a 12% decline in store base owing to strategic de-densification strategy as well as continued store closures across Europe due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

By sales mix, hardware and accessories sales increased 37.1% to $703.5 million. Software sales fell 4.6% to $397.9 million, while collectibles sales increased 93% to $175.4 million.           ",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/gamestop-gme-q1-loss-narrower-142702119.html

JULIAN EMANUEL: So again, you know, the bond market, like the stock market, has done virtually absolutely nothing within-- in a reasonably narrow range over the last couple of months. And I think, you know, given the volatility in all of these things away from meme stocks is so low, people concentrated on this move down, say, from 1.65% in the yield down to below 1.50% for the time being. We would attribute it to a couple of things. First of all, we have to remember that the virus is still a problem away from the United States. Europe is getting better, we know. But emerging markets-- obviously, there's news of renewed lockdowns, however small the scale, in China. And we have to remember that. And that kind of psychology has international investors, in particular, tilting towards fixed income. The other thing, though, is I think what we found out over the last three or four days, which the bond market was discounting several weeks ago, is that the Biden administration's ambitious spending plans are not going to be nearly as easy to execute as the market believed to be the case, you know, when this trading range began.

MYLES UDLAND: All right, let's move now to our biggest stock story we have been following for the last three weeks. That, of course, the resumption of the meme trade. But GameStop out last night. Of course, GameStop really the grand poobah here among these meme names. It was out with its latest quarterly results. And really, the biggest news is that they finally announced that they will have a new CEO. We see the results here beating on the top line about $1.3 billion in revenue during the most recent quarter. So GameStop certainly on track or on an annualized basis. Looking at revenues, north of $5 billion for the year, with the holiday quarter weighting, likely to do quite a bit better than that. Losses less than expected, more narrow than expected. But the company announcing that Matt Furlong will be its new CEO. He joins the company from Amazon. GameStop also announcing that Mike Recupero will be its next CFO. He also joins the company from Amazon. And so we see GameStop here overhauling its C-suite. They also announced, Julie, that they are having a $5 million at the market offering, doesn't mean that they have to offer that right now. But finally, seeing GameStop be a little bit more aggressive in coming to market to use the value of its currency, which of course, is its share price, which even with an 8% decline today trading at $280 per share. And we remind viewers once again that about a year ago, this was a $4 stock. JULIE HYMAN: Yes, indeed, it was a $4 stock and it's made a lot of money for a lot of people. As I was looking through the results here, and not just the results, but the commentary from Ryan Cohen, I kept thinking about Keith Gill a.k.a. Roaring Kitty, who was one of the first people to publicly pound the table on this stock as we know. He became quite famous for doing so later. But initially, there weren't too many other people following him.                 ",https://finance.yahoo.com/video/gamestop-sinks-over-sec-investigation-132852048.html

The Week","The Labor Department reported Thursday that consumer prices jumped 5 percent in May versus a year earlier. That's the biggest rise in inflation since 2008, and it was steeper than expected, but ""right now, it's a yellow traffic light situation,"" The Washington Post reports. ""People are on alert, but there's no panic or slamming of brakes."" There are two main reasons economists and nonpartisan policymakers aren't panicking: First, prices were really low last May due to the COVID-19 pandemic, making a return to normal prices look dramatic, and second, the price increases for many products were due to temporary shortages in supply or materials. Those factors loomed large in the six categories of goods and services that accounted for half the jump in the consume price index (CPI), Bloomberg economists calculate: Used cars, rental cars, car insurance, airfares, hotels, and restaurants. And of those six categories, used cars and trucks account for about a third of the total monthly CPI increase, the Labor Department says. A dearth of new cars, due largely to production delays caused by a pandemic-related global semiconductor shortage, ""has tightened the supply of used cars as owners hold on to their vehicles longer — which, in turn, sent the prices of used cars and trucks soaring 29.7 percent in May, versus a year ago,"" The Wall Street Journal explains. And because rental car companies can't restock fleets of cars they sold off last year amid slumping demand, prices for car rentals soared 110 percent in May. ""As the economy adjusts to a post-pandemic world,"" the Post says, ""suppliers will adjust. Shortages will dissipate. Factories will eventually produce more furniture, washers, cars, and computer chips,"" and the price increases will likely be short-lived. However, ""price increases on services, including rent, often stick around for years to come, especially if companies bump up wages by several dollars,"" the Post explains. ""Businesses often turn around and pass those extra costs on to consumers. Then employees ask for more pay again and the price hike cycle begins.""",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/used-cars-trucks-drove-much-122407770.html

FX Empire","The Dollar/Yen is inching higher early Friday as investors continue to digest yesterday’s U.S. consumer inflation report while looking ahead to next week’s two-day Federal Reserve monetary policy meeting. The U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose 5% in May on a year-over-year basis, its highest level since the summer of 2008, but the surge in inflation looks to be temporary and should not push the Federal Reserve to tighten policy for now. This assessment helped drive down U.S. Treasury yields, tightening the spread between U.S. Government bonds and Japanese Government bonds, making the U.S. Dollar a less-attractive asset. At 05:56 GMT, the USD/JPY is trading 109.421, up 0.098 or +0.09%. The main trend is down according to the daily swing chart. A trade through 109.192 will signal a resumption of the downtrend. A move through 110.329 will change the main trend to up. A move through 109.192 will also turn 109.796 into a new secondary lower top. This will be a sign of increasing selling pressure. The intermediate range is 110.966 to 107.479. The USD/JPY is currently trading inside its retracement zone at 109.223 to 109.634. Inside this range is a minor pivot at 109.445. The short-term range is 107.479 to 110.329. If the downtrend continues then look for the selling to extend into its retracement zone at 108.904 to 108.568. The long-term range is 108.230 to 107.154. The direction of the USD/JPY on Friday is likely to be determined by trader reaction to the pivot at 109.445. A sustained move under 109.445 will indicate the presence of sellers. This could lead to a labored break with potential downside targets coming in at 109.223 and 109.192. If 109.192 fails as support then look for the selling to possibly extend into the short-term retracement zone at 108.904 to 108.568. A sustained move over 109.445 will signal the presence of buyers. The first upside target is the Fibonacci level at 109.634. Since the main trend is down, sellers could come in on a test of this level.

Bloomberg","(Bloomberg) -- U.S. equities eked out a gain in choppy trading as investors continued to assess the outlook for inflation and the path of Federal Reserve monetary policy. Ten-year Treasury yields held at around the lowest since March. Friday’s advance of 0.2% came a day after the S&P 500 notched its first all-time high since early May as data showed U.S. consumer price increases in May were largely driven by categories associated with economic reopenings, bolstering the view that inflation pressures may ease later in the year. Treasury yields inched higher, with the 10-year rate still ending the week below 1.5%. Stocks swung between gains and losses in lighter-than-average trading volume, with gains in technology shares offsetting losses in the health care and real estate sectors. Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc. fell the most after halting development of a key therapy. The volatility in the U.S. came after global stocks rallied. With the Fed setting a high bar for reconsidering its dovish stance, Thursday’s inflation report ended up stoking risk appetite across the world. Now investors are looking ahead to next week’s policy meeting for clues about the Fed’s next moves with regards asset purchases and interest rates. “Our base view is still that growth and inflation remain buoyant and supportive of risk assets,” said Rob Haworth, senior investment strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management. “It’s been interesting to watch rates tick lower and stay lower. That seems to imply the market is believing the Fed is going to remain lower for longer and hold rates there.” The U.S. central bank’s view that inflationary pressures are temporary has taken hold in global markets, signaling any changes in ultra-accommodative policy would happen very gradually. That approach was also reinforced across the Atlantic Thursday, as the European Central Bank raised its inflation forecast and renewed a pledge to maintain faster emergency bond-buying to sustain the euro area.

2021-06-10T10:21:16.000Z,Will GameStop be saved by former Amazon executives who served under Jeff Bezos?,"GameStop's new chairman Ryan Cohen (aka Chewy's founder) is betting a big chunk of his wealth on disciples of outgoing Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos' unrelenting, take no prisoners in the pursuit of winning culture being able to completely revamp the struggling gaming retailer.  A supportive and enthusiastic retail investor base gathered in-person at the GameStop's Grapevine, Tex., headquarters and on social media fixated on the company's annual shareholder meeting Wednesday. At the meeting GameStop announced that Matt Furlong will be the company's next CEO, effective June 21.  According to his LinkedIn profile, Furlong has spent eight years and eight months at tech beast Amazon. He joined in October 2012 from Procter & Gamble as a senior manager of vendor development. Furlong has spent the last two years leading Amazon's Australian business.  Serving as Robin to Furlong's Batman, Mike Recupero was announced as the company's next CFO. Recupero begins at GameStop on July 21. Where did Recupero get recruited from? You guessed it, Amazon.  Recupero has spent the last 17 years with Amazon, rising the ranks through the e-commerce giant's finance functions, per his LinkedIn profile. Most recently, Recupero held the CFO position of Amazon's North America consumer business.  The latest Amazon defectors will join several others recruited by GameStop from the tenure of Jeff Bezos' CEO rule (which ends July 5).  Elliott Wilke: Wilke started as GameStop's chief growth officer on April 5. Wilke spent eight years at Amazon, ending his stint at the company as a director of Amazon Fresh stores. At GameStop, Wilke is focused on growth strategies, improving the chain's loyalty program and marketing.  Jenna Owens: Owens began as GameStop's chief operating officer on March 29. Owens logged over four years at Amazon, ending as director, general manager, distribution and multi-channel fulfillment. At GameStop, Owens oversees business intelligence, fulfillment, supply chain, and store operations. Her LinkedIn profile says she is hiring at GameStop. We wouldn't be surprised if some of those hires come from her former employer. Matt Francis: Francis became GameStop's chief technology officer on Feb. 15. He had the shortest stint at Amazon among GameStop's new leaders, leaving as an engineering leader for Amazon Web Services after a year to join GameStop. Francis now oversees GameStop's e-commerce and tech functions. Essentially, Cohen — who no doubt knows Amazon well having battled them hard while launching pet products seller Chewy in 2011 — has packed the GameStop executive ranks with deep experience from the best retailer on Earth. Not a bad move, especially considering they all likely know each other (camaraderie is important on an executive team) and are cut from the same Bezos leadership cloth (and frankly, surviving Amazon's intense culture for a number of years earns each executive a gold star in this writer's book).

2021-06-10T09:18:37.000Z,"GameStop falls 27% on potential share sale, other 'meme stocks' falter","By Sinéad Carew, Aaron Saldanha and Sagarika Jaisinghani (Reuters) - Shares of GameStop Corp lost more than a quarter of their value on Thursday and other so-called meme stocks also declined in a sell-off that hit a broad range of names favored by retail investors. The video game retailer’s shares closed down 27.16% at $220.39, their biggest one-day percentage loss in 11 weeks. The drop came a day after GameStop said in a quarterly report that it may sell up to 5 million new shares, sparking concerns of potential dilution for existing shareholders. ""The threat of dilution from the five million-share sale is the dagger in the hearts of GameStop shareholders,"" said Jake Dollarhide, chief executive officer of Longbow Asset Management. ""The meme trade is not working today, so logic for at least one day has returned."" Soaring rallies in the shares of GameStop and AMC Entertainment Holdings over the past month have helped reinvigorate the meme stock frenzy that began earlier this year and fueled big moves in a fresh crop of names popular with investors on forums such as Reddit’s WallStreetBets. Many of those names traded lower on Thursday, with shares of Clover Health Investments Corp down 15.2%, burger chain Wendy’s falling 3.1% and prison operator Geo Group Inc, one of the more recently minted meme stocks, down nearly 20% after surging more than 38% on Wednesday. AMC shares were off more than 13%. Worries that other companies could leverage recent stock price gains by announcing share sales may be rippling out to the broader meme stock universe, said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Cresset Capital. AMC last week took advantage of a 400% surge in its share price since mid-May to announce a pair of stock offerings. ""It appears that other companies, like GameStop, are hoping to follow AMC’s lead by issuing shares and otherwise profit from the meme stocks run-up,” Ablin said. “Investors are taking a dim view of that strategy.""

Click to skip ahead and jump to the 5 Biggest Stock Scams In Recent Years. Money doesn't bring happiness is a fine saying, but only if you have enough money not to have to worry about basic things. Ask a person who doesn't know how to pay next month's rent, or reducing his food portions so his children can eat properly, whether money would bring happiness or not. This is why nearly every person in the world would like to be rich, or at least well-off. Most people work at least eight hours a day and many of them generally tend to only make enough to make basic ends meet, and maybe if they're lucky enough, they still get to save some money for a rainy day. Only a few are lucky enough to make much more than they need, and live a life of wealth and luxury. And the fact is, things are getting even tougher now. A few decades ago, even earning the minimum salary would allow people in the United States to fulfil their basic necessities. Even an average job with little to no mental pressure would allow you to raise a family and buy a decent house with a mortgage that wouldn't overwhelm you and little to no student loans that would stifle the very existence of your being. But, cost of living has increased a lot over the past few decades while wages unfortunately, have not followed suit. This is why the minimum wage of $7.5 an hour is not even close to enough to allow someone to cover basic necessities. On the other hand, even if you have a decent job with savings, simply putting the savings in a bank will not be sufficient to sustain you if you fall on hard times, or even when you're looking at retirement. If all the money you save remains in your bank, you are basically actually losing money as inflation decreases the monetary worth of your earnings. Hence, the one and only way to actually consistently increase your savings and remain comfortable is to invest your money.

Fear of earnings dilution because of the company’s plans to issue 5 million shares from “time to time” added to the negative sentiment. The earnings of the video games retailer have been keenly awaited the last few quarters given the craze for the stock among the retail investors. The company said its second quarter sales trends, the only indicator it provided for the ongoing quarter, continue to reflect momentum, with May total sales increasing approximately 27% compared with last year. It also reported an adjusted net loss for the quarter ended May 1 of $29.4 million or 45 cents per diluted share, compared with a $157.6-million loss or $2.44 per diluted share in the fiscal 2020 first quarter. Net sales rose by more than a quarter from a year ago period to $1.27 billion, overcoming a nearly 12% reduction in the company’s global store base due to strategic reasons and continued store closures across Europe because of the pandemic. The company has additionally appointed a new CEO and a CFO, both of whom are Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) veterans.

2021-06-10T05:17:53.000Z,"U.S. CPI, ECB Meeting, Bitcoin and GameStop - What's Moving Markets","By Peter Nurse Investing.com — Much-anticipated U.S. consumer prices are due for release, the ECB meets, Bitcoin rebounds after El Salavador adopts the digital currency, GameStop shakes up its boardroom, while crude slips lower. Here's what's moving markets on Thursday, June 10th. 1. U.S. CPI looms large It’s finally here. Investors have largely started on the sidelines this week ahead of the release of the Labor Department's consumer price index report. It’s due for release at 8:30 AM ET (1230 GMT), and will be one of the last major economic indicators before the Fed’s next policy meeting June 15-16. Consumer prices are rising quickly as the economy reopens after the pandemic, and this CPI report is expected to show prices rose another 0.4% in May, pushing annual inflation above April’s 4.2%, already the highest in more than a decade, to 4.7%. Investors are studying this number carefully for clues on the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy path, especially after the strong April number and the repeated assurances from central bank policy makers that elevated inflation will be temporary in nature. A strong number could put Fed members under heavy pressure to defend these views, and many think the average expectation of an annual rise of 4.7% is conservative. Part of the Fed’s rationale that the price spike will be temporary is the lack of wage growth for years, particularly at the lower end of the pay scale. However, last week’s jobs report showed a larger-than-forecast pickup in average hourly wages for a second straight month, raising the dreaded prospect of a wage-price spiral. “We are likely in for another inflation shocker in June,” said analysts at Nordea, in a note, “but the question is whether the market will explain it away as a transitory effect.” The CPI release is not the only important data release, with the number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits in the week ending June 5 seen dropping by 15,000 to 370,000 from 385,000 the previous week, also at 8:30 AM ET, in a further sign of economic reopening.

2021-06-09T22:53:52.000Z,GameStop Taps Amazon Vet as CEO; Share-Sale Plan Sinks Stock,"(Bloomberg) -- GameStop Corp. is tapping a pair of Amazon.com Inc. executives to lead the company and may sell millions of additional shares to raise money, part of a drive to convert the brick-and-mortar chain into an e-commerce powerhouse. Matt Furlong, who oversaw Amazon’s Australian business, will become chief executive officer of GameStop, while fellow Amazon veteran Mike Recupero will serve as chief financial officer, the video-game seller said Wednesday. Furlong starts on June 21, and Recupero begins work July 12. “It seems like they’re committed to the playbook of bringing in some Amazon DNA to run the company,” said Doug Clinton, managing partner at Loup Ventures. “The substance will come when we start hearing about the long-term plan.” The stock sale involves as many as 5 million shares offered through a so-called at-the-market program, and the prospect of dilution didn’t sit well with current investors. The shares tumbled as much as 14% to $261.61 in late trading following the announcement. GameStop also disclosed an investigation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission into recent trading activity. The management changes are part of a vision laid out by activist investor Ryan Cohen, who became GameStop’s chairman at its annual meeting Wednesday. He’s orchestrated a shake-up of management, with an eye to shifting GameStop away from its roots as a mall-based retailer and toward selling a broad range of products online. Along the way, GameStop became the face of meme stocks -- shares that trade more on social-media buzz than underlying fundamentals -- and the stock has surged more than 1,500% in 2021. SEC Probe The unusual trading of GameStop and others has drawn the interest of the SEC. GameStop said Wednesday that it received a request from the agency’s staff for “voluntary production of documents and information concerning a SEC investigation into the trading activity in our securities and the securities of other companies.” GameStop doesn’t expect the inquiry to adversely affect the company.

2021-06-09T21:46:09.000Z,"GameStop (GME), RH (RH) Beat Q1 Estimates","Markets gave up their green arrows through the course of the day’s trading, closing at session lows, though nothing too remarkable: the Dow now has a three-day losing streak, -0.44% (-152 points), while the S&P 500 dropped 0.18% on the day, and again failing to set new record closing highs. The Nasdaq outperformed the other major indexes, closing at -0.09% and snapping a three-day winning streak. The small-cap Russell 2000 gave back some of its big gains over the past week, -0.71%.

Real Estate stayed among the best-performing segments of the S&P, and Utilities bounced back from yesterday’s sell-off. The 10-year bond closed below 1.5% for the first time in about a month, while Bitcoin strengthened 10.5% after a tough start to the week. Ultimately, we’re parsing through sand grains in a flat, directionless market. These periods happen. We may not be used to them after years of volatility, but the plateau near the top of all-time highs seems a comfortable place at the moment.

Here at Zacks, we value earnings and analysts’ expectations of them highly. That said, I bring you what may be the most inconsequential Q1 report you may ever see: GameStop GME reported a loss of 45 cents in its latest release after the bell today, improving from the -67 cents in the Zacks consensus and nearly a full dollar better than the -$1.61 per share reported in the year-ago quarter. Revenues also beat estimates: $1.28 billion versus $1.18 billion.

Shares of GameStop are trading down 3% on the news in the late session, clearly putting a substantial dent in the company’s 1500% year-to-date growth. The $20-billion market-cap brick and mortar video game chain is now up less than 85% over the past month. As Ryan Cohen moves to Chairman, incoming CEO Matt Furlong and CFO Mike Recupero were both previously executives at Amazon AMZN, indicating GameStop may be headed toward an e-commerce-centric business model.

Oh, so THAT explains the company’s valuation!

Meanwhile, luxury retailer RH RH continues its superior earnings performance, reaching $4.89 per share in its Q1 release, which easily surpassed the $4.20 expected and is worlds beyond the $1.27 per share the company reported a year ago. Sales of $861 million grew 78% year over year, and more than $100 million greater than the $756 million analysts were looking for.

Guidance for next quarter was equally robust: +35-37% expected in its Q2 top line, with revenue growth +25-30% for the full year. Earlier projections had been for just under 20% revenue gains for the fiscal year. Gross margins of 42.3% would be impressive for a tech company, let alone a retailer of high-end furniture and accessories. Shares are up 6% in late trading on the impressive quarter. RH has not missed on quarterly earnings for five years.

2021-06-09T21:24:21.000Z,GameStop Warns of SEC Probe Into Trading Just as New CEO Debuts,"(Bloomberg) -- GameStop Corp., one of the popular “meme” companies whose stock has soared this year, said U.S. securities regulators are looking into the trading of its shares. The video-game retailer said Wednesday that staffers from the Securities and Exchange Commission contacted the company on May 26, for voluntary production of documents and information related to the stock. “We are in the process of reviewing the request and producing the requested documents and intend to cooperate fully with the SEC staff regarding this matter,” the company said in a quarterly filing. “This inquiry is not expected to adversely impact us.” Since February, securities regulators have been combing social media and message-board posts for signs that fraud played a role in dizzying stock swings for GameStop, AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. and other companies, people familiar with the matter said at the time. GameStop is one of a handful of stocks that have been fueled by Reddit traders who invest based on social-media buzz. Shares of the money-losing chain have gained 1,500% this year, closing Wednesday at $302.56. The stock fell as much as 13% in extended trading after the company announced it may issue new shares, along with the hiring of two Amazon.com Inc. veterans for top leadership roles and fiscal first-quarter results.

Bloomberg","(Bloomberg) -- For all the hubbub around meme stocks in recent weeks, it was on a day that the day-trader favorites plunged that the S&P 500 Index climbed to its first record close since early May. Tech shares climbed 0.8%, led by stalwarts Amazon.com Inc., propelling the benchmark for American equities to an all-time high of 4,239.18 GameStop Corp. plunged 27% and AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. sank 13%, dragging a Goldman Sachs Group Inc. basket of meme stocks to a 6% loss on Thursday. For months, the broad market was stuck in a limited range as day traders flocked to shares with elevated short interests to profit from short-squeezed rallies. That split performance reversed Thursday as investors brushed aside stronger-than-expected inflation data and bet that the Federal Reserve will maintain its ultra-accommodative policies. Meanwhile, GameStop led the retreat in retail favorites after the company said it planned to sell more shares and offered few details about its turnaround strategy. “The market is higher today because huge parts of the market like big tech are getting some reprieve from lower rates while more economically sensitive equities are still getting support,” Tallbacken Capital Advisors’ Michael Purves said. “It’s largely a win-win day for the broader market, and if AMC and GME are down a lot, it is really a sideshow.” Seven of the S&P 500’s 11 major industries advanced, driving the benchmark above the previous record notched in early May. The tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 jumped 1.1% to the highest level since April. By contrast, day-traders darlings fell back to Earth. GameStop, one of the first meme-stock icons, dropped the most since March, cutting its 2021 advance to 1,070%. AMC, another headliner of this year’s retail mania, fell more than 10% for a second day, trimming its year-to-date gain to 1,919%.

2021-06-09T21:03:40.000Z,SEC Chairman Proposes Review of Rules Underpinning Stock Trading,"(Bloomberg) -- Wall Street’s top regulator is calling for a broad review of rules that underpin U.S. equity trading, the latest evidence that the meme-stock mayhem is likely to trigger an overhaul. U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler said Wednesday that he’s asked the agency’s staff to examine best execution requirements -- legal mandates that ostensibly force brokers to process customers’ orders at advantageous prices. Gensler added that the process for settling transactions could be shortened to the same day. He also reiterated concerns that companies behind popular smartphone apps have profit incentives to hook consumers on trading. Trading rules have come under scrutiny amid wild swings for GameStop Corp., AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. and other companies. While Gensler didn’t mention them by name, he directed some of his most pointed comments to market makers like Citadel Securities LLC and Virtu Financial Inc. Those firms pay retail brokers a fee to execute clients’ trade orders. “Brokers profit when investors trade,” Gensler said in a speech at the Piper Sandler Global Exchange & FinTech Conference. “For those brokers who have these arrangements -- and not all do -- higher trading volume generates more payment for order flow. What makes the current zero-commission brokerage environment different is that investors do not see their costs as they’re executing trades, so they may perceive them as free.” Virtu slid 7.7% in New York trading, its biggest one-day slump since September. Interactive Brokers Group Inc. and Charles Schwab Corp. also declined. Gensler, who took over the agency in April, has said previously that there are inherent conflicts tied to payment for order flow and that the SEC was looking closely at whether it needs to revamp regulations. On Wednesday, Gensler said that he’d directed the SEC staff to focus on whether retail investors are indeed getting the best deal for their trades. He raised issues around best-execution requirements that brokers must comply with when handling trades.         ",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/sec-chairman-proposes-review-rules-170039390.html

Bloomberg","(Bloomberg) -- Gold erased early losses after U.S. inflation data showed domestic prices rising slightly faster than expected, causing real Treasury yields to decline. The increase in the U.S. consumer price index in May extends a months-long buildup in inflation that risks becoming more established as the economy strengthens. Real yields eased after the data due to the strong gain in inflation expectations, boosting the appeal of non-interest-bearing bullion. The data came after the European Central Bank renewed its pledge to maintain faster emergency bond buying. Also helping gold was speculation that the rise in the U.S. price index won’t be enough to force the Federal Reserve to change its dovish stance, said Carsten Fritsch, an analyst at Commerzbank AG. Traders will now focus on the Fed’s meeting next week and the annual gathering in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, according to Paul Wong, market strategist at Sprott Asset Management. Investors are trying to assess how long will inflation can run hot before the Fed tapers, said Wong.

GameStop is out with earnings, also announcing a few executive changes. Jared Blikre has that for us. Jared. JARED BLIKRE: That's right. Let's do the big news first because there is a shakeup in the C-suite. They have a new CEO and new CFO, chief financial officer. First on the CEO, Matt Furlong, who they describe as a veteran e-commerce leader and technology industry executive. He comes from Amazon, by the way. He once headed up Amazon Australia. And then for the chief financial officer, Mike Recupero, also coming from Amazon. Pretty interesting there. Seasoned technology industry finance executive. So let's go over the numbers because they are still relevant. We got beats on both the top and bottom lines. Net sales coming in at $1.28 billion. That's up 25% year over year. Estimate was for lower, $1.17 billion. The adjusted loss per share was $0.45. The Street was expecting $0.71. So, narrower, better than expected. A year ago, it was a loss of $1.61 per share. Also taking a look at the operating loss of $40.8 million, that compares to $108 million in the fiscal 2020 first quarter. And they're continuing to suspend all guidance. As you can imagine, the company is a huge black box. But we're going to get on that earnings call. And I'm assuming Ryan Cohen as executive chairman will be on there. And he can offer some clarity about these new choices to head up their C-suite. Interesting to note that the stock initial direction was down by about 6%.

The news was released a few minutes before its first quarter results, which topped analysts' estimates.  The company said it tapped Matt Furlong as CEO, effective June 21. Most recently, Furlong was a Country Leader for Amazon's Australia business, and was previously a technical advisor to the head of Amazon's North American consumer business.  GameStop is also bringing on Mike Recupero as CFO beginning July 12. Like Furlong, Recupero also has a multi-year history at Amazon, and most recently served as chief financial officer of the e-commerce giant's North American consumer business. ""These appointments reflect the refreshed Board’s focus on building a technology company and investing in growth,"" the company said in a statement.  The announcements Wednesday afternoon added to a slew of recent personnel changes at the video game retailer.

The appointments also represent the latest in a string of key hires pulled from Amazon, underscoring GameStop's increased ambitions in e-commerce. In March, the company brought on another ex-Amazon director, Jenna Owens, as chief operating officer.

The company also announced two Amazon veterans would be joining the company as chief executive officer and chief financial officer. Shares traded 5% lower during the after hours session before paring some losses. Here were the main results from GameStop's report compared to consensus estimates compiled by Bloomberg:  Q1 Revenue: $1.28 billion vs. $1.17 billion expected and $1.02 billion Y/Y  Q1 Adjusted loss per share: 45 cents vs. 71 cents expected and $1.61 Y/Y  GameStop, one of the original names to be pushed higher during a frenzy of retail investor activity earlier this year, has seen a renewed wave of interest online in recent weeks. Traders on platforms including Reddit's forum r/wallstreetbets have touted GameStop and other stocks like AMC Entertainment (AMC), BlackBerry (BB) and Bed Bath & Beyond (BBBY), which have each been the target of considerable short interest. In doing so, these users have helped stoke widespread purchases of these shares and catalyzed significant short squeezes, as those who bet against the stocks scrambled to cover their short positions.  According to data from S3 Partners, short interest in GameStop totaled $3.04 billion as of Tuesday's close, with 10.86 million shares shorted for a 19% short percent of float (the percentage of a company’s stock that has been shorted by institutional traders). Short sellers in GameStop were down by $294 million last week.  For many investors, company fundamentals have taken a back seat to the mass appeal of these stocks when making investment decisions. GameStop posted its fourth loss in the past five quarters in the three months ended in April, and the company said it was continuing to suspend guidance.

In a quarterly report that was stronger than analysts forecast, GameStop said it may sell up to 5 million new shares, which would be worth $1.4 billion based on its latest share price.    Matt Furlong, a nine-year Amazon veteran, will succeed George Sherman as chief executive officer. GameStop said Mike Recupero, who spent over 17 years at Amazon, will succeed Jim Bell as chief financial officer.    Furlong will join on June 21, while Recupero, who was chief financial officer of Amazon's North American consumer business, will come on board on July 12, the company said.    GameStop's shares have almost doubled in the past month, approaching their January high. That was when a massive surge driven by investors on Reddit's wallstreetbets trading forum made the stock the most traded on the U.S. market for several days.    The Securities and Exchange Commission requested documents and information related to an investigation into that trading, GameStop disclosed, along with trading in shares of other companies.    AMC Entertainment, Blackberry, Clover Health Investments and other recently surging so-called ""meme"" stocks fell more than 4% in extended trade on Wednesday.    Even after falling late on Wednesday, GameStop's stock has gained more than 1,300% in 2021.

2021-06-11T22:54:17.000Z,"Wall Street ekes out gains to close languid week
FX Empire","By Stephen Culp NEW YORK (Reuters) – U.S. stocks closed modestly higher at the end of a torpid week marked with few market-moving catalysts and persistent concerns over whether current inflation spikes could linger and cause the U.S. Federal Reserve to tighten its dovish policy sooner than expected. The Nasdaq gained the most among the three major indexes, while the bellwether S&P 500 squeaked its way to a second straight record closing high. For the week, the S&P and the Nasdaq advanced from last Friday’s close, while the Dow posted a small weekly loss. The indexes have been range-bound, with few catalysts to move investor sentiment. Much of the focus centered on Thursday’s consumer price data, which eased jitters over the duration of the current inflation wave. “It’s a muted day today,” Oliver Pursche, senior vice president at Wealthspire Advisors, in New York. “The summer is settling in, people are slipping out of work early and there’s nothing in the news that’s going to materially drive the market in either direction.” “So, investors are going to wait until earnings season.” The Federal Reserve has repeatedly said that near-term price surges will not metastasize into lasting inflation, an assertion reflected in the University of Michigan’s Consumer Sentiment report released on Friday, which showed inflation expectations easing from last month’s spike. Investors now turn their attention to the Fed’s statement at the conclusion of next week’s two-day monetary policy meeting, which will be parsed for clues regarding the central bank’s timetable for raising key interest rates. “Our view continues to be that inflationary data is transient and we will be around the 2% mark for the year,” Pursche added. Benchmark U.S. Treasury yields posted their biggest weekly drop in nearly a year, weighing on the interest-sensitive financial sector in recent sessions. The Food and Drug Administration is facing mounting criticism over its “accelerated approval” of Biogen Inc’s Alzheimer’s drug Aduhelm without strong evidence of its ability to combat the disease.

The video-game retailer is currently covered by four analysts tracked by Bloomberg, down from nine analysts at the beginning of the year. As of Wednesday, GameStop has two hold and two sell ratings, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Telsey Advisory Group was the latest firm to walk away from the stock, discontinuing coverage of GameStop earlier this week. Analyst Joe Feldman said the firm is always reevaluating what it makes sense to cover given which stocks are attracting interest from its clients. He said institutional investors have had “almost zero interest” in GameStop since January, when share-price volatility surged as Reddit users touted the stock. “Nothing from a real investor that wanted to learn more about the company, to get up to speed on the company, to invest real money in the company,” Feldman said in an interview. GameStop shares gained as much as 6.7% Wednesday ahead of the company’s earnings report expected after market close. The stock closed at $300 on Tuesday, almost five times the average analyst price target of $62, and is up 1,547% this year.

The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rules would address ""payment-for-order-flow,"" ""best execution"" and the ""national best bid and offer,"" among other structural issues, he told a virtual conference on financial technology and global markets at Piper Sandler on Wednesday. The aim was to make markets as efficient as possible, Gensler said. Payment-for-order flow, whereby wholesale market makers pay broker-dealers to send them client orders which they execute on their own trading platform or a third-party platform, raises a number of conflict-of-interest questions, he said. Critics say it creates an incentive for brokers to send orders to whichever market-maker pays them the highest fees, rather than the venue that might get the best deal for customers, also known as ""best execution."" Market-makers say the business model has increased liquidity and reduced costs for average investors. ""Are customers getting best execution in the context of that conflict? Are broker-dealers incentivized to encourage customers to trade more frequently than is in those customers’ best interest?"" Gensler asked during his speech. The SEC review follows January's Reddit rally during which retail investors coordinating on Reddit and trading through low-cost brokerages drove up GameStop and other ""meme stocks."" Amid the intense volatility, several retail brokers restricted trading in the affected stocks, which took the steam out of the rally, causing an uproar among retail traders. Robinhood, an online retail brokerage, said on Wednesday that it looks forward ""to engaging"" with SEC as the agency considers changes to equity market structure.

Nonetheless, a nod by the company’s chairman during the annual shareholder meeting in Texas today certainly didn’t hurt. According to reports, GameStop Chairman Ryan Cohen presided at the meeting, and he was quick to give credit where it was due, calling the WallStreetBets crowd “special” and saying, “We’re fortunate to have such a special group of investors holding the company’s shares. You guys inspire us to think bigger, fight harder and work longer each day.” GameStop shares are up 3% at last check to USD 309.91. Cohen isn’t your average company chairman. He is an activist investor who only entered GameStop stock because he wanted to see the company take a different direction. After joining the board, he was nominated to the top spot in April amid a management shakeup. Cohen, who is also the co-founder of Chewy, is known for pushing the company to sell its brick-and-mortar locations in light of a shift in the gaming industry to a digital model. He officially becomes chairman of the GameStop board today. GameStop appears to have a second wind with Cohen at the board helm and the Reddit investor crowd in tow. The chairman reportedly discussed a new strategy for the gaming retailer but kept the details close to the vest. One thing that is clear is that he is focused on driving shareholder value, which suggests that investors could ride this train for the foreseeable future. Meme stocks are a mixed bag today. While GameStop is on a tear, yesterday’s darling Clover Health is a different story, with investors taking profits and sending the SPAC-related stock 10% lower. While it isn’t unusual for meme stocks to be volatile as retail investors and hedge funds wrestle for control, just yesterday Clover shares soared 85% and became the latest target of the WallStreetBets crowd. If Clover investors are hoping for similar gains they have seen with GME or AMC shares, however, they will have to be patient.

Some of the latest comments on new posts in r/WallStreetBets were filled with messages like ""CLNE to 15"" and ""So Fresh, So CLNE"" as users touted potential new candidates for a rally late Tuesday into Wednesday. The stock hit an intraday high of $14.50. Geo Group's stock also shared a similar profile to the original Reddit-fueled darlings. Geo Group's short interest comprises about 37% of its float, according to S3 data cited by Bloomberg on Wednesday. And the company also endured events earlier this year that sent the stock lower and made it more attractive to short sellers, after President Joe Biden signed an order to limit the government's use of private criminal detention facilities in a move that would impact Geo Group's federal partnerships.  Meanwhile, some of the other stocks that had been the subject of considerable online trader interest earlier this week already fell out of favor with some traders. Wendy's, the first fast food chain to become a notable meme stock this week, saw shares slide 11% intraday on Wednesday after jumping 26% a day earlier. The move lower also coincided with two downgrades from Wall Street firms Stifel and Northcoast, with analysts at both firms noting that the stock's valuation seemed difficult to justify after the rally.

2021-06-09T15:37:09.000Z,"Consumer Prices, Jobless Claims, Meme Earnings: 3 Things to Watch","By Dhirendra Tripathi Investing.com -- Investors stayed on the sidelines Wednesday as they have for the last few sessions, awaiting key inflation data that is scheduled for release Thursday. Already there are signs investors are buying into the Federal Reserve’s view that any inflation as the economy reopens is merely transitory. Bond yields dipped, supporting the tech trade but dinging financials. The short-covering in Treasuries comes just a day ahead of the consumer inflation data, with economists expecting to see the fastest annual pace since 2008. The dip in rates helped tech find its footing, attracting bids from investors who had ditched the sector when fears on valuation ran deep. Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow: 1. Consumer price data Economists expect inflation in the U.S., as measured by the Consumer Price Index, to rise 4.7% from a year earlier. It rose 4.2% in April, the fastest rise since 2008. The data are released at 8:30 AM ET (1230 GMT). 2. Jobless claims The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits in the week ending June 5 is seen dropping by 15,000 to 370,000 from 385,000 in the week ending May 29 in a further sign of economic reopening. This report is also out at 8:30 AM. Continuing jobless claims by individuals qualifying for unemployment insurance in the U.S. for the week ending June 5 are seen falling by 169,000 to 3.602 million from 3.771 million at the end of May 29. 3. Meme earnings Meme stock king GameStop Corp (NYSE:GME) is seen reporting a first quarter per-share loss of 67 cents on revenue of $1.13 billion after today’s closing bell.

2021-06-09T15:15:43.000Z,Clover Health rides Reddit-fueled 'meme stock' wave amid record-high trading volume,"Shares of Clover Health Investments, Corp. (CLOV) breached their previous 52-week high of $24.93 in pre-market Wednesday morning. This added to a total increase in the stock’s value of over 110% in the past week amid a Reddit push to short the stock. Following market open, its price fell just below Tuesday’s close $22.15. Founded in 2014 and headquartered in Tennessee, Clover Health is a Medicare-backed insurance seller with 458 full-time employees and provides preferred provider organization and health plans for Medicare-eligible consumers through its software platform. The company garnered attention recently as Redditors picked up on its potential for a short squeeze opportunity, gaining CLOV its “meme stock” status with the likes of AMC Entertainment (AMC), BlackBerry (BB), and GameStop (GME). Among the online appreciators of the company is Chamath Palihapitiya, American venture capitalist and CEO of Social Capital, who placed a $16 million bet on the special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) that allowed Clover to go public. Palihapitiya, who is no stranger to internet-fueled market frenzies, saw his investment skyrocket to $682 million after a Tuesday gain of over 30%. Sentiments surrounding the recent rally starkly contrast those back in early February when Hindenburg Research, an investment research firm with a focus in activist short-selling which also publishes reports on alleged fraud by other companies, claimed that Clover had lured investors into purchasing its shares without disclosing its ongoing investigation by the Department of Justice. This triggered a spiral in Clover’s share price to its record low of $6.31. Past targets of Hindenburg include Nikola (NKLA) and Chinese crypto firm Ebang (EBON).

2021-06-09T15:13:50.000Z,GameStop Continues to Play Games with Fundamentals,"The famed meme stock, GameStop Corp. (GME) may have price action completely detached from its fundamentals as a business, but that does exclude it from releasing earnings reports. The video game retailer is slated to hold its earnings call after-market hours on Wednesday June 9. Year to date, GME shares have climbed an astounding 1,639.13%, mostly attributable to a high-profile short squeeze in January, as well as sustained retail enthusiasm ever since. For example, GameStop shares are up over 86% in the last 30 days. Although some of the most bullish investors are not expecting too much from earnings, they will inevitably be part of the story. (See GME stock analysis on TipRanks) Earnings Expectations A Wall Street consensus expects GameStop to release revenues of $1.16 billion, and an EPS of –0.67. GameStop has suspended its guidance and its transformation strategy continues to be more opaque than not. Past Profits In the previous quarter, GameStop underperformed its Wall Street EPS expectations of $1.46, instead hitting $1.34. (See GME earnings calendar on TipRanks) Analyst Recommendations On June 7, analyst Michael Pachter of Wedbush Securities reiterated a Sell rating on the stock, saying the current price valuation in no way reflects the business’s underlying fundamentals or cash flows. Pachter maintained his price target of $39, indicating a precipitous potential downside of 87% from the company’s $300 Tuesday closing share price. Pachter says that GameStop is best poised to capitalize from new gaming console releases and sales, although recent semiconductor supply chain constraints have limited sales growth. Pachter expects the net sales to miss Wall Street expectations, but is positive about the company's transition to eCommerce and its massive store closures in 2020. With that in mind, he stated that a return to profitability would be expected by the end of FY21. The analyst also wrote that it was unclear who would replace the current outgoing CEO, leaving more uncertainty about the future of the company. Additionally, how it would capitalize on the volatile rise in share price or not remains unclear.   ",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/gamestop-continues-play-games-fundamentals-151350203.html

[MUSIC PLAYING] JULIE HYMAN: But we start, as we frequently do at this hour, with the Morning Brief. And as usual, Myles is thinking about meme stocks, but thinking about them from a sort of different perspective, as we watch GameStop fall out of its earnings today. There is a big options-related dispersion in the potential outcomes in the shares following the earnings. I was noticing this morning, something like 20% is the amount it could move following the numbers. And we haven't talked as much about the whole options phenomenon around what we have seen in these meme stocks. That's something you wrote about this morning, Myles, as well as the idea that what turns out now to be perhaps a false idea that, once things were going to reopen again, people would get away from their trading screens and away from meme stocks. MYLES UDLAND: Yeah, so this report comes to us from the team over at Deutsche Bank, who's really been on top of following the meme trade. Big shout at Parag Thatte and the whole equity strategy team over there. And they had a note out, as they do at the end of each week, about flows and where investors are positioned right now, how overweight they are equities and so on and so forth. And one chart that they have flagged and tracked, really for the last several months, is single stock call options. So this is a bet on-- it's a contract that gives you the right but not the obligation to buy a stock at a future point in time. And in general, if you are buying a single stock call option, in general, you are saying, in general, you think that that stock is probably going to go up. So the blue line here is a spike in single stock call option activity within the market. Now, this was a major feature of the first go-around of the meme rally. That is where a lot of the confusion and struggles from investors, individual investors who were using options on Robinhood-- and most platforms require you to go through a whole educational thing before you can start trading options because it is not as simple as just buying or selling traditional equities.

We start this Hump Day looking at pre-market futures, which show the tech-heavy Nasdaq nosing back out ahead of the pack, +50 points.

Meme stocks are perhaps the single-biggest story in the market through the first half of the year, maybe even eclipsing the Great Reopening itself. Don’t believe me? Check out GameStop GME, which reports its Q1 after today’s closing bell. The company is expected to bring -67 cents per share in the quarter on $1.18 billion, with a rather unspectacular seven negative earnings surprises over the past five years.

Yet GameStop, which was the first of the Reddit r/wallstreetbets companies to squeeze shorts without mercy, is still +1640% year to date, +5950% over the past year. Due to its negative bottom-line, the company does not have a price-to-earnings ratio. And the company does more than 8.5 million in average trading volume. It has sent the shorting portfolio managers into full retreat, yet the company refuses to give up its gains. Will today’s earnings report mean anything?

2021-06-09T13:14:54.000Z,GameStop earnings: What to expect amid the latest meme frenzy,"Yahoo Finance’s Julie Hyman, Brian Sozzi, Myles Udland, and Emily McCormick preview GameStop’s first quarter earnings report. JULIE HYMAN: And GameStop reports its earnings after the close of trading, or, should I say, its losses after the close of trading. The company also is holding a shareholder meeting today at 11 AM at which Ryan Cohen is expected to be elected chairman of the company. Our Emily McCormick looking into the financials for this company. Emily, what are we expecting? EMILY MCCORMICK: Well, Julie, as you mentioned, the original poster child for the meme stock trade is reporting its fiscal first quarter results after the bell today. Now we should mention that much of the rally that we've seen in GameStop shares so far this year has not necessarily been tied to fundamental news, like earnings results, or quarterly results, we should say, so much as the popularity of the company on the Reddit forum Wall Street Bets. But tonight's report will still offer an update on GameStop's business following an almost 1,500% rally so far in 2021. And that includes an 86% surge in share prices over the past one month alone. Now GameStop is expected to post a fourth loss over the past five quarters, and this is for the three months ended in April. But that said, we are expected to see revenue grow 15%, which would mark the first year-on-year increase for the company in nearly three years. We should note, though, that last quarter, GameStop did decline to provide guidance for this year or for the current quarter that it will be reporting. And at the time, it did report fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share, or losses per share, I should say, revenue, and comparable sales that each missed estimates. So these metrics were covered from their worst points during the pandemic. Now we should note as well that as we've been talking a lot about on the program here, the meme stock rally really has broadened out in this latest wave we've been seeing over the past month. AMC Entertainment really has been one of the focal points of this latest rally. The company actually overtook GameStop's market capitalization last week. And just yesterday and into this morning, we are seeing a cohort of new stocks, including Wendy's, Wish, and Clover Health also seeing massive rallies. Now also do want to highlight that GameStop is still a pretty heavily shorted stock, although short interest has come down considerably compared to the beginning of 2021. Just to highlight a couple of metrics, we have short interest in GameStop totaling just over $3 billion as of yesterday's close. And that comprised a 19% short percentage of float. And short sellers were down by about $294 million last week, according to S3 data. So again, still seeing some short interest here. Short sellers still getting burned, for the most part, when it comes to casting bets against rises in shares of GameStop. But as it comes to the company's fundamentals, we'll get an update on that front after market close today. Julie.",https://finance.yahoo.com/video/expect-gamestop-q1-earnings-amid-131454216.html

2021-06-09T10:12:38.000Z,GameStop gains as traders await quarterly report,"By Noel Randewich and Svea Herbst-Bayliss (Reuters) -GameStop's stock jumped 7% on Wednesday before the company was due to release its quarterly results, which a cult following of individual investors will scrutinize for progress in the videogame retailer's turnaround amid this year's rally in its shares. The stock extended gains and was on track to end the session at its highest closing price since January. Top shareholder Ryan Cohen, the billionaire co-founder of online pet supplies retailer Chewy, was elected chairman at a brief annual shareholders meeting ahead of the report. GameStop previously announced his nomination. ""As my dad would say, buckle up,” Cohen told shareholders. GameStop's volatile shares have doubled in the past month, and they are now just 7% below their closing high in January. That was when a massive surge driven by investors on Reddit's wallstreetbets trading forum made the stock the most traded on the U.S. market for several days. A recent rally in AMC Entertainment Holdings has attracted increased attention from individual investors and commenters on wallstreetbets, but GameStop remains one of the most discussed stocks on the forum. AMC tumbled 8%, and it remains up over 2,200% year to date, compared to a rise of over 1,600% in GameStop. Options prices imply GameStop's stock could swing 24% in either direction by Friday, according to Trade Alert data. While the recent rollout of new videogame consoles is likely to benefit GameStop, analysts warn that its soaring stock price has become disconnected from the company's day-to-day business. At least two Wall Street analysts recently dropped coverage of the company. GameStop's core business of selling new and pre-owned videogame disks is shrinking as consumers move to downloading games digitally or streaming, and it has lost money for the past three years. Cohen hopes to transition GameStop into an ecommerce business that can take on big-box retailers. He told shareholders at Wednesday's meeting in Grapevine, Texas that they had ""ushered in a whole new era at GameStop,"" but he declined to provide a detailed plan.

Subscribe Wednesday, June 9, 2021 We know you know: the meme trade is back.  Clover Health (CLOV) and Wendy's (WEN) were the stars on Tuesday, rallying after shares became the most popular tickers on wallstreetbets, the Reddit forum tracked closely by traders, media members, and Wall Street pros alike for signs of where retail investors might throw their weight around next.  And while some investors and Wall Street strategists aren't too interested in tracking the daily ebbs and flows in meme names, the equity strategy team at Deutsche Bank has for months now been chronicling flows clearly influenced by these new market participants.  And no area of the market has been more shaped by retail participation than single-stock call options.  Single-stock call options are contracts that offer investors the right, but not the obligation, to buy a stock at a certain price in the future. Typically, investors buy call options on a stock they think will rise in price. So a true YOLO trade in the meme market isn't just buying a stock people on Reddit are talking about, it's buying a stock people on Reddit are talking about while also using derivatives to make an even bigger bet on that stock.  And while each of us will only live once, stock market memes can clearly live multiple lives. ""Call volumes picked up sharply over the last two weeks while put volumes remained subdued, taking the put/call ratio close to 15 year lows,"" said Deutsche Bank strategists led by Parag Thatte in a note published on Friday. ""The increase has been led by single stock options and ETFs, while index call option volumes have remained largely flat to down.

TipRanks","Despite the high volatility, it's been a positive week for investors in Clover Health Investments (CLOV), but it's ending in a downgrade to Sell from Bank of America. From Monday's opening price through Wednesday's intraday high of $28.85, Clover stock appeared to be on track to triple in share price by week-end. But enthusiasm for the meme stock peaked early in the morning hours of Wednesday, and fell steeply all day long. Then, in a real ""kick 'em when they're down"" moment, Bank of America stepped in Thursday morning to downgrade the stock from ""neutral"" to ""underperform"" (i.e. sell), assigning a $10 price target. This figure suggests shares will decline ~34% over the next 12 months. So why did Bank of America downgrade Clover? Analyst Kevin Fischbeck explains: ""After the recent spike in CLOV, we are downgrading [because] the company is now trading at a 70% premium to ALHC [its closest comparable stock] despite a similar growth profile and lower near term margin trajectory."" Although the analyst believes that Clover is likely to outgrow the Medicare Advantage market as a whole, it may not grow 70%-pricier-than-the-competition fast. Simply put, the current growth trajectory, as Fischbeck estimates it, doesn't justify the premium price that Clover stock fetches after its run-up. In addition to the valuation argument, Fischbeck also has concerns about the business proper: Company filings, says the analyst, ""gave multi-year guidance on membership growth for both"" Medicare Advantage and Direct Contracting. However, Clover cut its guidance for 2021 Medicare Advantage growth in its Q4 2020 earnings report, explaining that the pandemic hurt sales. Then, in Q1 2021, the company cut estimates for Direct Contracting as well. Although Fischbeck accepted Clover's explanations for both cuts, calling them ""completely understandable,"" the cuts still weren't good news, and the analyst complained that the relatively abrupt change in guidance ""leaves us with low visibility into the outlook"" for the company.

And you can see right now, we're looking at the Dow being down about 23 points. We've got the S&P 500. It's still positive, almost 1 and 1/2 points. And the NASDAQ is up about 47, almost 50 points. But when we take a look at where we're watching performance in the Dow right now, some of the losers, as we head toward the closing bell. Procter & Gamble off by more than 1%. Walgreens, Boots-- they're down almost 1%. Goldman Sachs also off about 1%, as we head toward that closing bell. And then the sector action today, as we keep an eye on this for you. You can see that we've been watching energy go up. But right now, energy is still a gainer. It's up about 1% with consumer staples down about 1%. We've got communication services also negative. But consumer discretionary is up about 1%. We're keeping an eye on all of this, Seana, and team, as we head toward that closing bell. If we can pull back and show you again that the Dow at this point, falling about 31 points. The S&P 500 up just about 1 point. And there we go. We have a closing bell. [BELL RINGING] [MUSIC PLAYING] SEANA SMITH: And that does it for the trading day today again as we see the gavel come down here marking the end. We saw a bit of a sell-off here into the close. The Dow closing off 31 points. The S&P just above the flat line, actually, barely holding onto gains. The NASDAQ was the outperformer all day, as we saw a rebound in some of those tech names. The NASDAQ closing up just around 3/10 of a percent. Adam was mentioning the sector action that we saw today. Consumer discretionary, energy, and real estate among the outperformers.                      ",https://finance.yahoo.com/video/market-recap-tuesday-june-8-203729765.html
2021-06-08T20:17:13.000Z,Clover Health Roars to Record as Short Sellers Get Burned,"(Bloomberg) -- Clover Health Inc., a health insurer backed by venture capitalist Chamath Palihapitiya, was swept up in meme-stock mania on Tuesday, posting a second day of wild gains as retail investors banded together to punish short-sellers betting against the company. Clover rallied 86% to close at $22.15 in New York trading after briefly doubling intraday. The gains erased five months of losses in the stock -- which formed part of a broader selloff in Palihapitiya-backed companies -- in just two days. Trading volume in Clover was more than 29 times the three-month daily average on Tuesday, with a record 718 million shares changing hands. The sudden flurry of demand comes after retail traders realized that short-sellers had been swelling their bets against Clover, a move that left them vulnerable if the stock were to start rallying. The stock’s story -- like many retail plays -- has left behind fundamentals with shares trading above $20, that’s more than twice the average analyst estimate. On the Reddit forum WallStreetBets, chatter has built this week on the potential for a short-squeeze in the stock, following similar successful ploys on meme stocks including Workhorse Group Inc. and Richard Branson’s space exploration company Virgin Galactic Holdings Inc., which advanced 12% and 8.1%, respectively. Bearish bets in Clover have been steadily climbing since March and now stand at over $580 million or 44% of the public float, according to data from S3 Partners. Daytraders also touted the stock’s potential inclusion into the Russell indices -- a rebalancing of those benchmarks is expected toward the end of June.

(Updates to market close)    By Stephen Culp    NEW YORK, June 8 (Reuters) - Wall Street stocks struggled for closing gains on Tuesday as a lack of clear market catalysts kept institutional investors in a holding pattern, while retail traders kept the rally of so-called meme stocks alive.    All three major U.S. stock indexes ended the range-bound session near flat or higher.    The tech-laded Nasdaq fared best, with Amazon.com Inc and Apple Inc providing the biggest boost.    ""We're waiting for inflation numbers, waiting for more from the (Federal Reserve), waiting for earnings season,"" said Paul Nolte, portfolio manager at Kingsview Asset Management in Chicago. ""There's not a lot motivating the market today.""    ""We're in this twilight zone until probably right after the Fourth of July, when we see earnings season kick in,"" Nolte added.    The CBOE volatility index, a measure of investor anxiety, touched its lowest level in over a year.    Smallcaps, once again buoyed by the ongoing meme stock retail frenzy, were outperforming their larger counterparts.    Clover Health Investments seized top billing among meme stocks, and ended the session as the largest percentage gainer in the Nasdaq.    Other stocks whose recent explosive trading volumes have been attributed to social media buzz, including GameStop Corp , Bed Bath & Beyond Inc, Workhorse Group and others ended sharply higher.    ""(Meme stocks) are where the action is, but you flip it over and look crypto and that's a mess,"" Nolte said.

2021-06-11T20:00:44.000Z,"Stock market news live updates: S&P 500 ekes out record closing high as traders shake off inflation concerns
Yahoo Finance","Stocks ended a choppy session higher, eking out a fresh record high on Friday as investors looked beyond a stronger-than-expected print on inflation. The S&P 500 set a new record closing high, topping its previous record level from Thursday. The Dow and Nasdaq also ended in positive territory. The 10-year yield dipped back below 1.5%.  The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported on Thursday that its headline consumer price index rose by 5.0%, or by the most since 2008, in May. Core consumer prices, which exclude volatile food and energy prices, surged at the fastest rate since the 1990s, extending gains after an already strong April report. U.S. stocks reacted less negatively to the report than they had in April, however, with the S&P 500 jumping to a new record high.  “The inflation outlook has rightfully been top of mind since last month’s blowout report,” LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick said in a note Thursday. “Under the hood, though, we think the picture is a bit more sanguine than the headlines would suggest, and still believe inflation will be relatively well-contained over the intermediate-to-long term.” Investors have taken into account recent commentary from Federal Reserve officials around inflation. Many have said they see price increases as only transitory jumps off last year's pandemic-depressed lows, and have telegraphed a willingness to tolerate a period of above-target – or above 2% – inflation following years of undershooting. Next week's Federal Reserve policy decision may help further reaffirm this stance, and solidify that the central bank still believes the economy has a ways to go in recovering from the pandemic before the Fed moves to adjust its pull back on its quantitative easing program or raise rates.  ""I think that investors may have had some concern that if inflation was too hot that there would be fears of Fed tightening and a real significant tightening of financial conditions and that would weigh on equities,"" Brian Levitt, Invesco global market strategist, told Yahoo Finance. ""I would argue that it's a market that's saying, yea it's inflationary, it's not going to get out of hand. You may see some steps to normalize policy over time.""                                                     ",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/stock-market-news-live-updates-june-11-2021-235234640.html
2021-06-11T16:17:14.000Z,"S&P 500 Ends Week at New Record High as Bulls Find Feet Late
Investing.com","By Yasin Ebrahim Investing.com – The S&P 500 closed at another record Friday, as a late show of investor appetite for stocks rounded off a week in which a hotter inflation report was largely cast aside ahead of the Federal Reserve meeting next week. The S&P 500 rose 0.19% to end the day at a closing high of 4,247. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.04%, or 13 points, and the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.35%. Wall Street was sluggish after making a bright start to the session, though the marching feet of the bulls returned leading up to the closing bell. Investors were keen on keeping their powder dry ahead of the Federal Reserve's two-day meeting ending Wednesday as bets on surprising from the central bank are few and far between. The backdrop of mixed economic data will help the central bank leaned into its view of an uneven recovery that still requires support. The labor market isn't making the job gains many had expected, while inflation has surprised to the upside, though is widely assumed to be transitory. ""Since the last meeting, economic data have delivered more questions and answers. In light of the uncertainty, it's hard to imagine any changes in the Fed's messaging,"" Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) said in a report. While Fed members have recently shown an appetite to begin the talk on tapering, Chairman Jerome Powell isn’t expected to give much away. ""Powell will no doubt be asked about any tapering discussions in light of the April FOMC minutes. We expect him to echo Clarida and Quarles and say that is might be appropriate to start talking about it in the next few meetings, but the Committee is not there yet,"" Jefferies added. This backdrop of humdrum has been captured in recent market moves amid a lack of conviction from traders to make meaningful bets in either direction. The bond market, however, has offered up noteworthy moves as the 10-year yield slipped below 1.5%, helping tech stocks continue their win streak, which is set to stretch to four weeks.

2021-06-08T17:36:46.000Z,"Meme stock frenzy is distracting investors from 'huge opportunities,' Datatrek says","There is probably a lot of trash in the speculative boom currently taking hold of markets. But hidden amid the meme stocks, SPACs, and crypto coins could be some valuable businesses. “Somewhere in the hundreds of SPACs and scores of meme stocks are some decent companies and potentially even a few huge opportunities,” DataTrek’s Nicholas Colas wrote in a note this week. “For example: Hertz, which was supposed to be a retail investor graveyard, actually exited bankruptcy with its equity value intact. The same exact thing happened with U-Haul about 20 years ago, by the way.” While many of the assets used for speculation may have similar price spikes as viral interest or short interest affect people’s perceptions, most of these things are all pretty different, with different stories and long term possibilities. Take Hertz. Last year, the company was bankrupt and shares were on a roller coaster — investors could try to double or triple their money in a day. But if an investor held on and didn’t sell shares out of boredom or when the stock stopped being compelling (Yahoo Finance traffic data showed interest and trading volume fell off in July 2020) they would be in a pretty good situation, returns-wise. Hertz had fallen from a June 2020 peak of over $6 to well under a dollar during the months after interest waned and was delisted from the NYSE in 2020. But in May, it ended up being worth over $6 a share when the company emerged from bankruptcy via auction, rewarding shareholders who stayed. The only thesis there would have been “this name-brand rental car company would get its mojo back when people start renting cars again,” not a huge jump. On the SPAC boom, Colas mused that most will probably fail or at least “dramatically underperform,” but that “somewhere in this barrage of moonshots there will almost certainly be a few huge winners that leverage disruptive technology.”                   ",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/meme-stock-frenzy-is-distracting-investors-from-huge-opportunities-datatrek-says-173646965.html
2021-06-08T17:31:25.000Z,GameStop stock sent higher by meme trading army ahead of earnings,"The meme stock army is showing its support for the OG of the 2021 retail trading movement — GameStop (GME) — ahead of the company's earnings on Wednesday evening. Shares of GameStop rose as much as 6% to $292 in afternoon trading on Tuesday as fast-money traders positioned themselves prior to the earnings release. GameStop was among the top five most commented stocks on social media, according to data from social monitoring service HypeEquity. Talk on social media of call options on GameStop — or a bet on the stock rising in the short-term — outpaced chatter of put options by a five-to-one ratio.  HypeEquity data shows traders keen on pushing GameStop's stock above $300 before earnings hit the tape.  Over on SwaggyStocks, another social media tracking platform, GameStop's stock was the fourth most commented on ticker on Reddit's WallStreetBets page. Positive mentions on the stock outnumbered negative mentions by six times. It's clear meme traders continue to overlook the present fundamental state of GameStop (which is bad). Instead they appear to be staying true to large shareholder and soon-to-be chairman Ryan Cohen (aka Chewy co-founder) outlining some form of revitalization plan for the chain in 2021. Speaking to GameStop's fundamentals, here is what Wall Street expects from the retailer in the first quarter. Note that the Bloomberg compiled consensus estimates only reflect projections from three analysts. Most sell-side analysts have dropped coverage of GameStop given the heightened volatility of its stock during the meme army's uprising.  Net Sales: $1.17 billion, up 14.6% from a year ago Adjusted Operating Profits: loss of $67 million vs. a loss of $98.8 million a year ago Adjusted Diluted EPS: loss of 71 cents vs. loss of $1.61 a year ago One of those analysts that recently pulled coverage on GameStop owing to insane levels of volatility is Bank of America's Curtis Nagle.

2021-06-08T15:59:58.000Z,Wendy's just became the first fast-food meme stock — but there is a catch,"Beloved burger and Frosty chain Wendy's (WEN) has won the honor of being the first fast-food stock to get roped into the red-hot meme stock trade. Shares of Wendy's spiked 16% in early afternoon trading on Tuesday after a favorable mention by traders on Reddit. The Wendy's ticker page was the second most trafficked on the Yahoo Finance platform, behind other meme crowd favorite Clover Health (whose stock popped 55% out of nowhere). Wendy's stock outperformed the slight decline in meme stock darling AMC Entertainment and a 6% rise in the OG of meme trading, GameStop (which reports earnings on Wednesday).  ""We’re aware of the unusual trading activity this morning and we’re closely monitoring,"" a Wendy's spokesperson told Yahoo Finance.  There are at least two striking things with the out of left field move in Wendy's shares Tuesday.  First, only 4.64% of the company's outstanding shares are sold short, according to Yahoo Finance Plus data. That runs counter to the high short position stocks that have characterized this year's meme stock trade. In other words, Wall Street is in no way betting against the future of Wendy's, dissimilar to GameStop and AMC.  And that brings us to the second point. The reason why Wall Street doesn't hate Wendy's is that unlike other meme stocks, Wendy's is a fundamentally sound business that is growing.  Wendy's U.S. same-store sales in the first quarter surged 13.5%, powered by diners heading back out after getting their COVID-19 vaccine and trying the chain's new breakfast menu. Digital ordering and a push into more premium chicken sandwiches also lit a fire under first quarter sales. Wendy's same-store sales internationally rose 7.9%. The Dave Thomas creation almost beat out McDonald's U.S.'s 13.6% same-store sales increase in the quarter, the latter of which could be seen as a letdown considering it launched three new chicken sandwiches. Same-store sales for Burger King in the U.S. rose 6.6% in the quarter.

2021-06-08T15:05:32.000Z,Why GameStop Stock Rallies Ahead Of The Earnings Report,"GameStop Video 08.06.21. Shares of GameStop gained strong upside momentum today as traders continued to push the stock higher ahead of the release of the company’s first quarter fiscal 2021 earnings report. The report will be issued on Wednesday, June 9, 2021, after the market close. Analysts expect that GameStop will report a loss of $0.83 per share. Earnings estimates for the full-year have actually trended down in recent months, and the market expects that GameStop will report a loss of $1.02 per share, which is projected to be followed by a loss of $0.59 per share in the next year. Typically, declining earnings estimates serve as a bearish catalyst for a stock, but GameStop’s valuation is completely detached from fundamentals so it remains to be seen whether traders will pay attention to the company’s financials when it releases its earnings report. The key question for the market right now is whether traders will use the earnings report as a catalyst to sell GameStop shares as the company is overvalued by any meaningful valuation metric. I’d note that Gamestop shares are moving higher at a very low trading volume compared to the volume that we have seen back in January – March when the stock was especially active. This means that there are few sellers of the stock, which allows buyers to push the company’s shares higher without using significant funds. In addition, the thin market is a true nightmare for short sellers who are trying to get out of their positions. At this point, it looks that dynamics of GameStop shares will depend on social media activity and short sellers’ problems rather than on the company’s earnings report. However, if the market decides to focus on GameStop’s earnings instead of the current short squeeze, the stock may gain significant downside momentum.

2021-06-08T10:04:12.000Z,Big updates on tap for the biggest stories in the market,"This article first appeared in the Morning Brief. Get the Morning Brief sent directly to your inbox every Monday to Friday by 6:30 a.m. ET. Subscribe Tuesday, June 8, 2021 Yes, we know, it's already Tuesday.  But a really interesting week for economic data and corporate news is just getting underway.  Later this morning we'll kick off three straight days of data that will offer updates on the biggest debates happening in the market right now — the labor market recovery, inflation pressures, and meme stocks.  In a way, all of these arguments can be connected with something like: Are people making so much money trading meme stocks with their stimulus checks that they don't need to go back work? And so on and so forth.  But each of these debates can also get quite detached from what the latest data tell us is or is not going on. Labor, prices, and the social role of markets are financial as well as political questions. And they each attempt an answer at what we should do with our time and how we should be compensated for it.  Fortunately, the next three days offer us data, not opinions, on developments along each front. The philosophical debates can resume in a week.  Thursday morning's inflation reading for May is likely to be the biggest market mover.  The consumer price index for May is expected to rise 4.7% over last year, which would be the most since 2008. On a ""core"" basis, which strips out the more volatile cost of food and gas and is preferred by policymakers, prices are expected to rise 3.4%. This print would be the hottest annual core inflation reading since the early '90s.  As Yahoo Finance's Emily McCormick outlined in a preview all of this week's economic data, Wall Street economists see inflation as a ""secondary"" concern when compared to talk about the Fed pulling back on its bond purchase program. But as we wrote in the Morning Brief last month, investors seem to be growing impatient with the Fed's insistence that inflation pressures will be transitory. Impatience that grew after just one month of hotter-than-expected inflation. A second straight month of inflation beating expectations would only heighten this debate.

2021-06-08T06:18:23.000Z,"How to Tell If AMC, GameStop Can Make the Russell 1000","(Bloomberg) -- The Russell Reconstitution is a big deal every year, but this time, potential changes for GameStop Corp. and AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. make it interesting for a broader swath of investors than normal. The annual reconstitution of Russell’s U.S. family of indexes accounts for market changes in the previous year, and it affects more than $10.6 trillion in investor assets benchmarked to, or invested in, products based on the Russell U.S. Indexes, according to its website. Trading volumes on U.S. exchanges also tend to be among the heaviest of the year around the event. Will AMC and GameStop be moved into the large-cap Russell 1000 from the small-cap Russell 2000? The key date was May 7. The reconstitution ranks and market cap breaks for the Russell Indexes are determined based on information available on rank day -- this year, May 7 -- according to Catherine Yoshimoto, FTSE Russell’s director of product management. An existing Russell 2000 index member would have had to have a total market cap exceeding $7.3 billion in order to move into the Russell 1000 index, she said. Going by that, AMC -- with a market cap of $4.28 billion on May 7 -- would fall short of inclusion, while GameStop and its $11.97 billion market cap would make it. As of Friday’s close, after big rallies in the last month, GameStop had a market capitalization of $18.4 billion. AMC’s is $24.6 billion. The reconstitution process is pretty formulaic: There’s a whole cottage industry of analysts who predict changes to the indexes in advance with high accuracy. A preliminary ranking is done by Russell on May 7. The first round of information was announced on Friday, with the preliminary list of additions and deletions from the Russell 3000 (that’s a combination of the Russell 1000 and Russell 2000). Here are key quotes from Friday’s press release: “The market capitalization breakpoint which separates companies in the U.S. large-cap Russell 1000 Index and companies in the U.S. small-cap Russell 2000 Index increased by 73% from $3.0 billion in 2020 to $5.2 billion for 2021.”“The closely-watched final index membership lists, with breakouts for the Russell 1000 Index, the Russell 2000 Index and the Russell Midcap Index, will be published on Monday, June 28 when the Russell Reconstitution takes effect and the newly reconstituted indexes begin to operate.”    ",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tell-whether-amc-gamestop-russell-120012129.html
2021-06-08T05:35:16.000Z,Meme Stocks Set To Extend Gains Tuesday,"By Dhirendra Tripathi Investing.com — Meme stocks, led by AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC), looked set to extend their gains for the second consecutive session rising 2%-5% in premarket Tuesday. The favorite of the Reddit gang, AMC, was up more than 4% while GameStop (NYSE:GME) and BlackBerry (NYSE:BB) gained approximately 2% and 3%, respectively. Meme stocks have defied the naysayers consistently over the last six months and while GameStop and Blackberry (TSX:BB) may be significantly off their year’s highs, it’s not been a flash in the pan. In the process, the stocks have made new highs several times and created wealth for many even as their books may not yet deserve those valuations. The companies are trying though. To the surprise of many, AMC has raised $1.24 billion in equity in three installments in less than a month, each at a different price, and proposes to sell 25 million more shares in 2022. GameStop, once a bankruptcy candidate, has reshuffled its top management as it tries to become a multichannel global retailer, retired part of its debt and created new facilities. Blackberry continues to strengthen its security software portfolio, have more cloud-based offerings and forge new partnerships.

2021-06-07T22:07:47.000Z,"Unlike GameStop, AMC keeps selling into meme stock mania","AMC Entertainment, the movie theater chain-turned-surging meme stock, has been cashing in on its unlikely rise. Since its stock started climbing at the end of January, the company has issued more than 100 million shares, unlike fellow internet darling GameStop, which has largely held off on selling new stock. Issuing new stock generally dilutes the value of a share, and is typically done when a company thinks its shares are overpriced. But so far, AMC’s stock price hasn’t really been hurt. China’s firewall is spreading globally In the last few weeks, AMC surpassed GameStop in market capitalization, the value of its outstanding shares, which shot up from around $5 billion at the start of April to a high of $34 billion last week. In that time, GameStop's market cap also grew, but less exuberantly, from around $13 billion to peak at $19 billion in June. An Indian billionaire who made his money bottling Pepsi is now taking his restaurant business public After riding the internet hype train to a new high of $62.55 a share last week, AMC told regulators that it would sell an additional 11.6 million new shares, even as it warned traders not to buy its common stock “unless you are prepared to incur the risk of losing all or a substantial portion of your investment.” Although AMC stock had fallen to $47.91 by the end of the week, today it shot up by 14% to $55 per share, showing that at least for now, the sell-off hasn’t had a major impact. After all, AMC was trading for less than $2 per share in January. AMC also plans to ask shareholders to approve a change to its corporate charter that would allow it to issue another 25 million shares. Since GameStop became a headline-grabbing meme stock in early January, the company has only issued 3.5 million new shares of its stock, and it did so in April, once the stock appeared somewhat more stable. Kelly Shue, a finance professor at the Yale School of Management, said that in issuing a significant amount of additional shares, AMC is following a “more standard corporate finance strategy” than GameStop. “When the GameStop share price was very high and it was the main hot meme stock, I think most corporate finance professors would’ve said, ‘Oh GameStop should issue more shares.’ And they actually chose not to really do that much,” Shue said. “Whereas AMC is very much following the standard playbook.”      ",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/unlike-gamestop-amc-keeps-selling-220747227.html

Bloomberg","(Bloomberg) -- After weeks of profiting from the stock and debt of AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc., hedge fund Mudrick Capital Management ended up with a 5.4% loss after a derivatives bet went haywire. The fund, which specializes in distressed debt, suffered the losses on AMC after day traders pushed the movie theater’s shares up as much as 127% on a single day, derailing call options Mudrick had sold on AMC shares to hedge exposure to the company, according to a person with knowledge of the matter. The Wall Street Journal earlier reported on the losses. Up until the improbable surge in AMC’s shares, the firm founded by Jason Mudrick had been among the big winners on AMC securities after the hedge fund agreed to help keep the cinema chain afloat last year by committing to buy new debt issued by the company. That and other AMC positions helped the fund reap almost $200 million in gains in January, Bloomberg News previously reported. Then the firm bought about $230 million of new shares from the company in a deal announced June 1, shares it quickly flipped to day traders and other AMC enthusiasts for another profit. But that’s when things started to unravel. To protect the firm’s holdings from a market plunge, Mudrick sold call options that gave other investors the right to buy shares from him at pre-set levels -- most of which were at $40 or more -- well above any price at which the shares had ever traded. As AMC’s stock surged June 2 in its Reddit-fueled frenzy, the price suddenly blasted past the prices at which the fund’s counterparties could cash in on the call options, the person said. The hedges ended up losing 10%, causing the net loss of 5.4%. A representative for Mudrick declined to comment. Shedding Risk Mudrick no longer has exposure to AMC after unwinding all of its debt, stock and derivatives bets. The firm is still up between 12% and 14% for the year, the person said. A risk committee for Mudrick Capital met virtually on the night of June 1 and decided to exit all debt and derivative positions the following day, the person said. Mudrick sold about a third of its exposure before the stock surged even further on June 2 and was fully out by that afternoon. The firm sold its 15% first-lien bonds in the theater chain for 121 cents on the dollar, the person added.       ",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/mudrick-amc-bet-backfires-meme-221912972.html
2021-06-07T19:37:29.000Z,Meme Stock Bulls Take Back Control as Hedge Fund Battle Rages,"After a wave of selling heading into the weekend, retail investors have wrestled back control of their favorite shorted stocks, including AMC Entertainment and GameStop. The stocks are off their highs of the day, and retail investors are convinced that something shady is going on. Short sellers are swinging back after losing USD 2.2 billion from AMC’s rally last week. There are theories of traders pulling out all the stops — including the illegal practice of naked shorting, which is currently trending on Twitter. Shares of AMC have galloped 16% today but still failed to cross the psychologically important USD 60 level, where the movie chain stock closed above on June 2 for the first time. While AMC might be off its peak, investors don’t have much to clamor about considering that the stock has skyrocketed more than 467% since early May. Fellow WallStreetBets stock GameStop is tacking on close to 11% in today’s session. The stock has gained more than 1,400% year-to-date for a market cap of USD 19.4 billion. GameStop investors have proven to be a loyal bunch as it hasn’t always been easy to hold. But those who have stuck around continue to be rewarded with more potential runway for gains. Ihor Dusaniwsky, managing director of predictive analytics at S3 Partners, revealed in a tweet that GMC and AMC each have a short squeeze risk score attached of 10 out of a possible 10. Meanwhile, the WallStreetBets crowd has taken over Twitter, with #nakedshorting trending on the social media site. To be clear, unlike regular shorting, which is legal, naked selling is not legal. It has to do with selling shares that have not been issued yet. Nonetheless, it still happens in the market. Naked shorting is how 140% of GameStop’s float can have short interest, as pointed out by Charles Payne on Fox Business. Christian, Smith & Jewell Law Firm Attorney Wes Christian said he blames the prime brokers that are custodying the assets as well as market makers for this behavior.

TipRanks","There’s a new FDA approved drug in town and an unexpected one at that. Going into Monday’s PDUFA date for aducanumab, Biogen’s (BIIB) Alzheimer’s disease drug, the general view on Wall Street was that the treatment’s chances of making it pass the regulators were pretty slim. In the end, however, the FDA sprung a surprise and gave the much-needed therapy its seal of approval. The importance of the occasion should not be taken lightly, says Cowen’s Phil Nadeau, who calls the approval of aducanumab – or its intended brand name Aduhelm - a “major milestone for Biogen, Alzheimer's research, and patients with Alzheimer's disease.” Like many, heading into the big decision day, Nadeau was pessimistic. “Following November's negative Ad. Com., we had been skeptical that approval was possible,” the 5-star analyst admitted. “Though it was clear the FDA reviewers wanted to approve Aduhelm, there did not seem to be a viable path since November's Ad. Com had concluded that clinical efficacy had not been established. However, proving once again that when there is a will there is a way, the FDA has granted accelerated approval to Aduhelm based on its ability to reduce beta amyloid levels in the brain.” Since 2003, the FDA had not authorized any new Alzheimer’s therapies, and Biogen’s is the first approved treatment which targets the underlying causes of Alzheimer’s, instead of just treating symptoms of the disease. While the FDA acknowledged the advisory committee’s negative opinion and controversies surrounding the drug’s filing, in the end, the regulatory body decided that the treatment’s benefits outweighed the risks. The FDA also noted Aduhelm reduced the level of amyloid plaques in a consistent and convincing manner, which is “reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit.” However, to confirm Aduhelm is clinically beneficial, Biogen must conduct a post-approval clinical trial, and if the drug fails to impress, the FDA will have the option to take the therapy off the market.

Reuters Videos","The U.S. Food and Drug Administration's decision this week to approve the first new Alzheimer's drug in nearly 20 years is facing mounting criticism - even from its own advisors. Three resigned in protest after Biogen’s treatment Aduhelm was granted (quote) “accelerated approval."" Regulatory and scientific experts say the FDA is taking its biggest risk yet with this strategy, which allows new therapies onto the market without strong evidence they work. The FDA has granted ""accelerated approval"" in more than 250 instances since 1992, but mainly for rare diseases or small patient populations that have had no effective treatments available to them. Aduhelm, however, is in a different league - both in terms of its potentially large patient pool and its hefty cost to the healthcare system - with each treatment costing $56,000 a year. In addition, the FDA ignored the recommendation of outside advisors, who said Biogen did not provide enough evidence of the drug’s clinical benefit – prompting the resignations. The FDA has defended its decision by saying Biogen presented clear evidence that Aduhelm removed amyloid plaques from the brains of people with Alzheimer's. Aduhelm must still go through a post-approval trial, after which the FDA can pull the drug from the market if it doesn’t meet required standards. But Biogen has said that trial could take nine years to complete. Patient advocate groups, like UsAgainstAlzheimer’s, have hailed the FDA’s decision, but critics - like Dr. Jason Karlawish, who ran one of the trial sites for Aduhelm – are concerned. Karlawish called the FDA’s decision (quote), “a disturbing set of events, scientifically, clinically, politically."" - The US food and Drug Administration's decision this week to approve the first new Alzheimer's drug in nearly 20 years is facing mounting criticism even from its own advisors.

ALEXIS CHRISTOFOROUS: I want to continue our discussion on the markets now and bring in Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National. Art, good to see you. I want to stick with these meme stocks and the fact that a lot of investors might not even know they own these stocks because they're part of the Russell 2000 Small Cap Value Index. I'm talking about AMC and GameStop among them. What do regular investors who don't want to play the meme game need to know about what's going on in that space right now? ART HOGAN: Yeah, it's such a great question, Alexis. And I think that-- I think you and Jared hit it right in the last section, where he said it's its own animal. And you said it's a frenzy, right? So understand that that's what's going on right now. It's a separate sideshow. It is its own animal. It is a frenzy. It's a mania. But if you are along the Russell 2000, the IWM, part of the movement you've seen in the Russell 2000 has been because of companies like AMC and GameStop. And that will continue to be the case until they reconstitute that index. And actually, these names are going to get kicked out because they're too large. This is the function of if they're going to be put into the Russell 1,000, right? So that's what happens once a year, where it just so happens that that's happening this month. But in the near term, understand that if there's a handful of meme stocks that are rotating in and out of favor, it could have a potential move on the Russell 2000. But understand very small, the percentage that AMC or GameStop, back in the day when GameStop was the only game in town. In meme land, I think that that had a bit of a move on the Russell, too. But I think the Russell, too, really has been driven. Because it's domestically focused, focused on the US economy. Small cap tend to be cyclical. There's a lot of energy and financials in there. So I think there's a lot more fundamental drivers for the Russell 2000 right now versus that poll that has been the meme stock frenzy.

2021-06-07T18:17:49.000Z,Reddit’s WallStreetBets has a new favorite stock,"GameStop and AMC are trading at levels no one could have imagined a year ago. Now, Reddit’s r/WallStreetBets community is looking for the next company whose stock is set to explode—and seems to have settled on Blackberry. The company behind the once iconic line of pagers and smartphones has seen its shares increase 137% year to date. That’s nothing compared to the 1,472% increase in GameStop and the 2,705% bump for AMC, but it’s the biggest surge the company has seen in two years. And, judging by chatter on r/WallStreetBets, interest is growing. A look at the subreddit Monday finds seven of the top 20 posts are dedicated solely to Blackberry. (Four others are focused on praising Clover Health Investments.) The stock is currently trading in the $15-$16 range, but the most enthusiastic investors are hoping to see it hit $50. “Don’t stop, BBelieving!!” encouraged user TehlorO. Meanwhile, user Substantial_Diver_34 showed a screenshot of what he says is his portfolio that is 100% committed to Blackberry, with over 6,400 shares. It was, at the time of the shot, down $14,000. The post is entitled “What have I done?” Other users gave nothing but encouragement. “I'll tell you what you've done: You've guaranteed your place amongst the millionares,” wrote kingandr3, while Firesice offered “You put in a winning bid...just needs a little time.” WSB bulls say Blackberry has grown from being a phone company to a cybersecurity firm that has deals with Amazon and others and could be well positioned to take a position in the electric vehicle marketspace. Analysts aren’t as sure. Four firms currently have “Sell” ratings on the company, with only one suggesting investors buy. Of course, the r/WallStreetBets effect often defies the logic of analysts. AMC and GameStop were floundering a year ago. Now, their stock prices and market caps have increased so much in recent months that they could join the Russell 1000 by the end of the month.

The sharp gains, however, have caught the attention of regulators at the Securities and Exchange Commission. On Monday the agency said it is looking into signs of market manipulation given the ""volatility in certain stocks.""    The volatility has also made it challenging for analysts to cover, with two analysts in the past week dropping coverage of GameStop, the stock that was catapulted higher in January by retail investors.    Cinema operator AMC Entertainment Holdings, which almost doubled in value again last week, was last up 21.1% at $58.00 while BlackBlerry's U.S. listing climbed 15.0% to $15.94 and put it up 56% since the start of June.

Since the start of 2021, the S&P 500 index has climbed 12.6%—which, if the year ended now, would be an above-average annual return. But that pales in comparison to shares of [hotlink]GameStop[/hotlink] (ticker: GME)—the alpha dog in the meme stock space—which are up a staggering 1,218% during that same span. When members of the r/WallStreetBets subreddit started buying GME and other meme stocks, including companies like BlackBerry (+109%) and AMC (+2,160%), in January, it looked like a classic pump and dump. Or a joke, in their eyes, meant to damage some hedge funds (read: Melvin Capital) while retail investors made a quick buck. For these three stocks, in particular, the dump hasn’t come. But that doesn’t rule out a pullback. Indeed, the prices of many of these meme stocks are completely out of whack with fundamentals. Just how detached are meme stocks from reality? There’s no better example than GameStop. When the 2021 edition of the Fortune 500, a ranking of the 500 largest U.S. publicly traded companies by revenue, was published last week, it did not have GameStop on it. That marked the end of GameStop’s 14-year streak on the list—including a No. 464 placement last year. Falling off the Fortune 500 list is just one of many signs that GameStop’s business model is floundering. Back in the aughts, GameStop stores in shopping malls and strip malls were packed with teenagers looking to buy and trade in games for their Xboxes and GameCubes. But in the early 2010s, that brick-and-mortar model was disrupted by the digitization of the video game industry, as more gamers began downloading new titles rather than buying physical copies. GameStop’s revenue, which peaked at $9.6 billion in 2012, had fallen to $6.5 billion by fiscal year 2020. Then the pandemic took it down another notch. During its 2021 fiscal year, which ran through Jan. 31, GameStop sales totaled $5.1 billion. Since 2012, its sales are down 47%.

The Group of Seven (G7) advanced economies agreed on Saturday to back a minimum global corporate tax rate of at least 15%, squeezing more money out of multinational companies such as Amazon.com and Google. But analysts said immediate market implications would be minimal since the details remained to be negotiated over the coming months. Shares of Apple Inc, Amazon.com Inc, Facebook Inc and Google-parent Alphabet Inc were trading flat to slightly lower, in line with the broader market's move. ""While it all sounds good, the road to implementation (of the tax deal) is full of rocks and potholes,"" said Ken Polcari, managing partner at Kace Capital Advisors. ""I would not react by becoming a seller in any of these names on this headline just yet."" U.S. stocks ended higher on Friday after a tepid U.S. monthly jobs report relieved investors concerned about the Federal Reserve scaling back its massive stimulus program sooner than expected. The benchmark S&P 500 is inches away from its record highs hit earlier in May as investors shift focus to May's consumer price data due on Thursday to assess inflationary patterns in the economy. ""There is no bearishness in the market, but the question among investors is - with all the optimism from economic reopening already been factored in, where the next push for growth would come from?"" said Rick Meckler, partner at Cherry Lane Investments in New Vernon, New Jersey.

2021-06-07T14:46:02.000Z,GameStop (GME) to Post Q1 Earnings: What Awaits the Stock?,"GameStop Corp. GME is likely to register top-line growth when it reports first-quarter fiscal 2021 numbers on Jun 9, after the closing bell. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $1,170 million, which indicates an increase of 14.6% from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure.

Speaking of the bottom line, the company is expected to report a loss for the quarter in review. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is currently pegged at a loss of 56 cents per share. The consensus mark has remained stable in the past 30 days. In the prior-year quarter, the company reported a loss of $1.61 per share. In the last reported quarter, the company’s bottom line outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 8.2%. GameStop’s top line during the first quarter is expected to have gained from growth in e-commerce sales. The company’s online wing is gaining from investments made toward boosting omni-channel capabilities that includes the roll-out of same-day delivery option across stores. Also, its expanded search and navigation features, post-purchase services, mobile app capabilities as well as flexible payment options have been supporting digital expansion. Additionally, increased demand for consoles, owing the company’s transition from generation eight to generation nine console gaming products, has been fueling online sales.

Apart from these, the company’s strategic efforts to boost assortments, optimize inventory and manage costs are likely to have supported first-quarter performance. Markedly, the company is focusing on high margin product categories such as PC gaming accessories, private label and collectibles.

On Apr 5, 2021, management provided details regarding its sales performance for the nine-week period ended Apr 3, 2021. Month-wise, with respect to sales in February (for the four-week period ended on Feb 27, 2021) total global sales increased approximately 5.3% year on year. In March (for the five-week period ended Apr 2, 2021), total global sales increased approximately 18% year on year.

However, during the first nine weeks of fiscal 2021, the company witnessed limited operations, primarily in Europe, due to pandemic-led government mandated restrictions. Also, the company operated with a 13% decline in its store base, due to strategic store optimization efforts. Such headwinds are likely to have been a drag on first-quarter performance. Also, we cannot ignore the concerns surrounding supply-chain constraints amid the pandemic as well as rise in freight expenses.

2021-06-07T14:31:20.000Z,SEC Says It’s Scrutinizing Market Swings as Meme Stocks Surge,"(Bloomberg) -- The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said it’s scrutinizing markets for signs of manipulation and other misconduct as AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. and other meme stocks continue to surge. “SEC staff continues to monitor the market in light of the ongoing volatility in certain stocks to determine if there have been any disruptions of the market, manipulative trading or other misconduct,” the agency said in a Monday emailed statement. “In addition, we will act to protect retail investors if violations of federal securities laws are found.” AMC resumed its upward trajectory Monday, halting two straight days of declines. The stock -- like GameStop Corp. before it -- has become a darling of retail traders. The movie-theater chain’s wild rise comes despite questionable fundamentals, prompting concerns among regulators that investors could be sitting on substantial losses if the stock plunges. The SEC has already said it’s investigating what happened with GameStop in January, with a focus on whether traders were using online message boards to dupe other investors into buying into the rally.

You can skip our detailed analysis of these fortunate short investors, and go directly to 5 Most Successful Short Sellers of All Time. Short selling has been getting a lot of attention amid the GameStop Corp. (NYSE: GME) saga that unfolded earlier this year and still continues to haunt various hedge funds, especially those who make money shorting stocks. Short selling has always been a risky investment strategy. According to a report by S3 Partners, shorts were down a whopping $245 billion in 2020. The firm's data shows that up till 2019, ten of the most shorted US companies had cost short sellers around $7.5 billion in market-to-market losses. Internet platforms and forums like Reddit and Robinhood have provided retail and general investors a way to unite and initiate ""short squeeze"" against institutional investors and major names who short companies. That's why when certain hedge funds started shorting AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc (NYSE: AMC) and GameStop Corp. (NYSE: GME), thousands of investors on Reddit started buying these stocks, resulting in millions of dollars in losses for funds like Gabriel Plotkin's Melvin Capital. But that doesn't mean shorting is always a bad strategy. Smart short sellers don't bet against companies randomly. They analyze securities, market trends and data. That's why in this article we will take a look at some of the most successful short sellers in the market's history. Some stocks you might be familiar with are some of the most shorted worldwide, showing how risky yet popular the process is. Up till 2019, Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA), AT&T Inc. (NYSE: T), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL), and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) were some of the most shorted stocks worldwide. This year, according to the Statista Research Department, PubMatic, Inc. (NASDAQ: PUBM) stands at the top of the most shorted stocks with a 50.82% share of float shorted. PubMatic, Inc. (NASDAQ: PUBM) is followed by Ontrak, Inc. (NASDAQ: OTRK) with a 45.56% share of float shorted, Blink Charging Co. (NASDAQ: BLNK) with a 37.82% share of float shorted, and Nikola Corporation (NASDAQ: NKLA) with a 36.81% share of float shorted.

MYLES UDLAND: OK, joining us now to talk about the state of the markets and how retail has been playing this market is JJ Kinahan. He's the Chief Market Strategist over at TD Ameritrade. So JJ, right before you came on, you heard us talking about what's happening with the meme names. You guys have your latest survey out of what your investors have moved in and out of the most. And a name that I did not see on that list was AMC. What have you seen on your side in some of these big names that really constitute kind of the core of the meme trade? JJ KINAHAN: Sure. So you know, if you think about it, AMC, GameStop, et cetera, for the last month wasn't necessarily as big a story. It became a bigger story right at the end of the month. What was interesting to me is when I looked at those stocks is that the week before Memorial-- so Memorial Day was a week ago today, it was last week on Tuesday that we really saw these explode. The week before, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday is when we actually saw our clients start to buy those names more. On Tuesday and Wednesday, our clients were more even in terms of their buying and selling of the stocks. So I thought that that part was really, really interesting overall. Obviously, the interest increased pretty significantly. Actually the one name that you didn't talk about but I know is part of the picture-- and just, you guys, it was a great discussion, had a lot to cover there-- was BlackBerry. BlackBerry was a name that in terms of percentage-wise, the volume picked up very significantly. Because GameStop and AMC continue to have this sort of interest all the time. And I thought it was interesting, you know, Julia was comparing some of this when we go down and people come in and buy it, to Tesla. And you know, and the stocks our clients purchased last month, Tesla was one of them, because they did sell off. And I think there was a little bit of a difference-- and it's one of the things you guys were talking about-- and that I also believe in talking to our clients that there's a belief that AMC is also a reopening play as much as a meme stock play, because people think that there is a hunger for movies and good movies, and people like the theater experience.

2021-06-07T13:27:28.000Z,"Meme stock favorites start the week higher, GameStop earnings in focus","Yahoo Finance's Myles Udland, Julie Hyman and Brian Sozzi break down how meme stocks are faring ahead of this week's inflation data. JULIE HYMAN: Well, as we look ahead to that inflation data, as we saw last week, markets abhor a vacuum, a news vacuum. And so one of the things that leapt into the breach were meme stocks last week and AMC in particular, as we saw that stock rise-- I think 86% was the final tally when all was said and done, even with a dip late in the week. the shares are up another 4.5% here this morning. Myles, I'm sure you were doing some deep thinking on the meme stock front over the course of the weekend and whether we would continue to see a lot of this action. I don't know that we know what exactly sparked the rally that we saw last week or the renewed interest in it, but it doesn't feel like that it's necessarily going away. MYLES UDLAND: No, I think the more that I think about it, the more that we cover these meme stocks as, really, the most interesting sub-story within the market-- because all the conversation we were just having with Brian and the direction of the economy, that's heady stuff. That is where the base of the trajectory for all of this is really formed. But the activity with meme stocks underneath the surface and the fact that it has now come up in essentially the same form a couple of times within three months-- and yet, as we discussed with Jared last week, and I'm sure we'll talk about as we get through this week, the lack of spillover between what's happened in the meme names and how sentiment within the broader market is reflected, I think, to me is the most instructive part of this story right now. I know there were a few stories out from a variety of publications over the weekend about the index industry and how some of the rally in the meme names opens that up to distortions within the construction of the index. Because obviously, if you have a market-cap-weighted index or market-cap-weighted type fund, and AMC is now double the size that it was, quadruple the size that it was, it can move that index or fund around a little bit more. Of course, if you're talking about the Russell 2000 or you're talking about even a sector-level index, its weighting is going to be still in the fractions of percentage points.

Revenue rose 25.1% year-over-year to $1.3 billion and beat consensus estimates of $1.2 billion. Management noted that sales increased even though the company operated fewer stores in the quarter. GameStop stores continued to be closed across Europe because of the COVID-19 pandemic. The adjusted loss of $0.45 per share improved from a loss of $2.44 per share a year ago and beat consensus expectations for a loss of $0.83 per share.

After raising $1.24 billion in equity in three installments in less than a month, each at a different price, it filed a preliminary proxy on Thursday seeking permission to sell 25 million more shares in 2022. It has been a roller-coaster for AMC traders who saw their stock double in just one session on Wednesday to hit a high of $83.63, only to fall in double digits on announcement of a new equity raise. The shares closed at $66.80 Friday. The pandemic has caused AMC's long-term debt levels to soar to $5.4 billion as of the first three months of this year from less than $2 billion in 2016. And it’s still losing money, with analysts expecting another $100 million to go over the next 12 months.

But for those who want to ride the wave of what's trending, there's an ETF for that, the recently launched FOMO ETF. Joining me now to discuss is Matthew Tuttle. He is CEO and CIO of Tuttle Capital Management. Thanks so much for joining me today, Matthew. MATTHEW TUTTLE: Thank you for having me. ALISSA CORAM: So first of all, FOMO is definitely a catchy phrase out there right now, the fear of missing out. And I think many investors experience that. Sound investing is based on rules. But emotion is also a very big part of investing. So give us your take on how investors can actually use this FOMO to their advantage. MATTHEW TUTTLE: Yeah, so there's so much going on right now in markets, more than we've ever seen. So you've got the meme stocks. You've got the crypto. You've got the value stocks. So what FOMO is designed to do is allow investors to get access to all of those areas. And then going forward, whatever it happens to be the hot area, because it's going to change over time, but to do it in a smarter way. So we're going to have the GameStops. We're going to have the AMCs. We're going to have some of the Bitcoin things and the blockchain things.

The remarkable surge in shares of AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. and a handful of other stocks is showing up in multiple exchange-traded funds, skewing portfolios, altering risk profiles and exerting outsized influence on prices. Take the $68 billion iShares Russell 2000 ETF (ticker IWM). In the past week through Thursday, AMC powered 70% of the product’s advance. The stock was responsible for less than a 10th of the fund’s return in the previous week. It’s a timely reminder that even diversified funds on autopilot remain subject to the whims and eccentricities that frequently lash markets out of nowhere. “For index investing, the appeal is that human decision-making, human emotions are taken out of it,” said Tom Essaye, a former Merrill Lynch trader who founded “the Sevens Report” newsletter. “That works all well and good until a stock that is supposed to be 50 basis points of the fund now becomes 6%.” The AMC effect can be seen across a range of funds. Alongside IWM, the $17.5 billion iShares Russell 2000 Value ETF (IWN) and $72 billion iShares Core S&P Small-Cap ETF (IJR) have also seen the stock’s influence climb. A similar phenomenon took place in January, when GameStop Corp. at one point surged more than 1,600%. Shares of the video-game retailer also rallied alongside AMC in the past week. The two companies are among a handful of shares dubbed meme stocks that are enjoying rapid, social-media fueled gains. “Once the rules have been drawn up in the land of indexing, once the play has been called in the huddle, you don’t have that discretion,” said Ben Johnson, Morningstar’s global director of ETF research. “You take whatever the market is going to give you and execute the plays.” Read more: Robinhood, Meme Stocks and Investing as a Game: QuickTake                         ",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amc-drama-exposing-risks-11-200000059.html

2021-06-05T05:31:50.000Z,Russell Reshuffle May Spell Trouble for Highflying Meme Stocks,"(Bloomberg) -- The upcoming Russell Indexes reshuffle could pose a problem for the likes of AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. and GameStop Corp. FTSE Russell’s annual Reconstitution event, which moves stocks around in its U.S. indexes based on their updated market cap and other characteristics, is set to call attention once again to the rise in so-called meme stocks that have been favorites of the retail-trading crowd. AMC is up more than 2,100% this year and GameStop over 1,200% -- with commensurate increases to their weighting in the Russell 2000 small-cap stock index. The two together now make up more than 1.1% of that gauge. But their enlarged market caps, with AMC at $24.6 billion and GameStop at $18.4 billion, put them squarely in line for a move to the Russell 1000 index of the biggest American companies. “The graduation of these high-fliers could be the beginning of the end of their epic run,” Wells Fargo analysts Christopher Harvey, Gary Liebowitz and Anna Han wrote in a note Friday. While there may be some buying beforehand from small-cap portfolio managers who are underweight those companies, that is likely to change for the stocks as the reconstitution takes effect, according to the analysts. “Once they graduate, their index representation drops (i.e., less impactful),” and portfolio mangers will have another year to wait for a shakeout on the stock prices, they said. AMC and GameStop have taken investors on a wild ride this year as they became darlings of retail traders. However, the stock action has boosted their prices well past where traditional Wall Street estimates would have put them. AMC is more than 800% above the average forecast of analysts covering the stock tracked by Bloomberg, the most for any U.S. stock with a market cap over $1 billion. The company is planning additional share issuance, and numerous insiders have cashed in on the stock’s runup. GameStop’s closing price Friday of $248.36 leaves its average 12-month target price of $55.80 in the dust.   ",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/russell-reshuffle-may-spell-trouble-053150145.html
2021-06-06T00:54:07.000Z,"Russell 2000 Swells; Investors Await Update on AMC, GameStopBloomberg","(Bloomberg) -- The total market capitalization of the Russell 2000 small-cap stock index jumped 84% over the past year amid the surging popularity of meme stocks and significant growth in the overall size of U.S.-listed companies. The market value of the index is now $3.5 trillion, according to benchmark provider FTSE Russell. The smallest stock on the Russell 2000, Velocity Financial Inc., is worth $257 million, up 171% from the $95 million value of the smallest stock in May 2020. The jump in the small cap companies reflected “the overall bounce back of U.S. equity markets following the Covid-19 recession in early 2020,” Catherine Yoshimoto, FTSE Russell director of product management, said in the statement. FTSE Russell gave the update as it announced its preliminary list of companies that will join or leave its Russell 3000 Index and Russell Microcap Index. The Russell 2000 has been in the spotlight because of high-profile members AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. and GameStop Corp., both of which have surged in value since the beginning of the year as social media-inspired retail traders have piled in. As a result, they’re likely to be removed from the small-cap index. FTSE Russell’s website was down on Friday evening New York time before it posted its statement later that night, as well as on Twitter Saturday morning. A company representative didn’t respond to a request for comment. The new composition of the Russell 1000 and Russell 2000 is expected to be detailed later in the month. Further updates to the lists will be posted on its website postmarket on June 11 and 18. The final changes will take effect June 28. Total U.S. equity market capitalization rose 52% to $47.7 trillion as of May 2021, the firm said. Over the past year, value stocks outperformed growth with the Russell 2000 Value Index posting a total return of 79% versus 50% for the growth index. (Adds comment in third paragraph.)

2021-06-04T16:40:19.000Z,"Wall Street Bets: Meme Stocks AMC, BB Take Investors on Roller Coaster RideFX Empire","Investors have gone along for the ride, vowing to hold on until they put the final nail in the coffin of short-sellers. Despite the volatility, shares of AMC Entertainment, in particular, have already almost doubled in price this week despite Thursday’s decline of close to 20%. AMC appears to be the tide lifting the meme-stock boat as other names including MicroVision, BlackBerry, Bed Bath & Beyond, Koss Corp and GameStop have either flipped green or are off their lows of the day. Wall Street analysts are doing the best they can keeping up with the WallStreetBets movement, which has seen individual investors gain influence in the stock market rally. Most recently, Wedbush Securities has shown its true colors, which apparently is a gray area. After shares of AMC touched on USD 60 this week, the firm lifted its price target on the stock by USD 1 to USD 7.50. At the same time, however, Wedbush analyst Alicia Reese also suggested a “justified price target” would be “as high as USD 10,” saying in a report, “AMC has made the best of its current ‘Meme Stock’ status by selling shares at a premium, and has raised significant capital doing so.” Another meme stock that is getting a lot of attention lately is BlackBerry. In the month of June so far, BlackBerry, the company behind the physical mobile keyboard that is making a comeback, is up nearly 30% to USD 15. The stock is coming off its strongest trading day ever based on trading volume after 528 million shares changed hands on Thursday, as per FactSet data cited by Barron’s, compared to today’s 104 million in volume as of midday today. For context, BlackBerry’s trading volume has only surpassed the 200 million threshold on eight separate occasions since the stock started trading. BlackBerry is trading below its highs of the year, since soaring to nearly USD 29 in January 2021, its highest level in a decade. After seeing what they could do to GameStop and AMC, the WallStreetBets crowd is reaching for the stars with BlackBerry, with visions of the company becoming the next Apple dancing in their heads.

The U.S. cinema chain is enjoying its ride on the ""meme stock"" rollercoaster, raising hundreds of millions of dollars with two share sales just this week. Wedbush Securities MD Daniel Ives says retail investors on Reddit are being joined by the big fish: ""Yeah, this is meme-made here, really taken over again, and I think you're really seeing just another leg to the story, which is obviously retail driven, but also institutional, I think sort of getting in on the party here, too."" $1.63 billion is the value of second-hand clothes nowadays. Or at least it's the price Etsy is paying for Depop - the London-based platform for trading new and used apparel. Etsy thinks the takeover will help it target Gen-Z, as young people wake up to the fashion industry's carbon footprint. 15% is reportedly U.S. President Joe Biden's proposed minimum level for corporate taxes. That's a big climb-down from the Democrat's earlier suggestion of 28%, but there's a kicker.

2021-06-04T21:06:19.000Z,Wall Street Reins In Hedge Funds’ Short Bets on Meme Stocks,"(Bloomberg) -- Wall Street’s top brokers are quietly tightening their rules for who can bet against retail traders’ most-popular meme stocks. Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Bank of America Corp., Citigroup Inc. and Jefferies Financial Group Inc. are among firms that have adjusted their risk controls at prime-brokerage operations, according to people familiar with the moves. The banks are trying to protect themselves against fallout from extreme surges and dips that have characterized trading in companies including AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc., MicroVision Inc. and GameStop Corp. The changes mean some hedge funds and other institutional investors now face higher collateral requirements or are limited from shorting certain stocks, the people said, asking not to be identified discussing internal policy decisions. “Until further notice, Jefferies Prime Brokerage will no longer offer custody on naked options” in GameStop, AMC and MicroVision, the firm said in a memo to clients seen by Bloomberg News. Naked options allow investors to short a stock without owning the underlying securities. Jefferies, which told clients that other stocks may be added to the list, will also no longer permit short sales of those securities. Representatives of Goldman, Bank of America,Citigroup and Jefferies declined to comment. It’s not unusual for banks to adjust their risk controls as market conditions change. The measures may change the fortunes of retail investors lighting up Reddit message boards with their forays into day trading. Increased margin requirements could hasten the short squeezes small investors have been rushing to capitalize on. On the other hand, if hedge funds pull back on short bets due to the new restrictions, the Reddit crowd won’t have as many opportunities to chase short squeezes. Archegos Fallout Many brokerage firms have been re-examining their risk controls after some of the industry’s largest prime brokers were forced in March to liquidate the multibillion-dollar portfolio of Bill Hwang’s Archegos Capital Management at a discount, though Bank of America and Citigroup were among those that escaped the saga unscathed. The little-known family office collapsed after making a series of wrong-way bets on media and technology companies.

2021-06-04T20:07:54.000Z,"Meme Stock Marauders Aside, the Average S&P 500 Bull Is WorriedBloomberg","(Bloomberg) -- Back in December, if you asked the typical investor what the next big move would be for the S&P 500, two-thirds would’ve said “up.” After two months of going-nowhere churn in the indexes punctuated by assorted hysterias in crypto and meme shares, barely half would say so now. For all the kookiness going on adjacent to more stolid stocks, the recent history in American risk markets is one of psychological retrenching. Institutional managers are reining in exposure. People are buying a lot more protection. Even flows to equity funds are slowing. The past week was a microcosm, with flyers like AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. and GameStop Corp. reprising the crowd-sourced moonshots that first launched in January, while the rest of the market sat still despite a host of catalysts ranging from President Joe Biden’s new tax pitch to weaker-than-expected data on the labor market. If anything, the gravity-defying rally in meme stocks is arousing angst for anyone who pays attention to business fundamentals. With equities hovering near the highest price-earnings ratios since the dot-com era, the market reflects what Chris Senyek calls a “perfection scenario,” where the economic outlook continues to improve, while inflation stays tame. That may limit future returns, he said. “Perfection is extremely difficult to attain,” Senyek, chief investment strategist at Wolfe Research, wrote in a note to clients earlier in the week. “We do believe that the next 10% move in U.S. equity markets is down, not up.” And there’s no shortage of threats on the horizon. President Biden has proposed raising corporate taxes to fund his infrastructure bill, while the Federal Reserve is expected to consider rolling back part of its monetary stimulus later this year. Not to mention the pressure on profit margins that American businesses face from surging prices on everything from lumber to oil and computer chips. In fact, either inflation or higher interest rates are cited as the biggest risk to equities in the latest survey that Evercore ISI conducted with investors and corporate clients. In the poll, released Friday, the proportion of respondents seeing the next 10% move in the stock market as being up has fallen to 51% from 66% in December.

You can see that's good for 183 points. S&P 500 up 9/10 of a percent-- look like it's at session highs or close to it right now. And the NASDAQ, big outperform of the day, up nearly 1 and 1/2%. We'll get a check inside the NASDAQ 100 where we see the mega caps still holding onto some nice gains. Off their highs a little bit, but check out Microsoft, up 2%. Alphabet and Apple, just a little bit less than that. And what stands out is Tesla. Tesla's up 4 and 1/2%, pulling back some of those nasty losses it had in the rest of the big week.

David, let me send it over to you first, because when you take a look at the market's reaction, it looks like the market was satisfied with this report even though it came in slightly weaker than what the Street was initially expecting to see.

Zack, what did we learn today about Bitcoin? ZACK GUZMAN: You know, Jared, we learned quite a bit. It was an interesting day. We've been here all day since 9:00 when this thing got kicked off. We're going to be here tomorrow as well, taping some segments here for us on Yahoo Finance. But really, I mean, a lot of the discussions we had coming into this centered around Elon Musk as well, in terms of his impact on where prices have been moving. He was tweeting last night with the heartbreak emoji talking about, you know, his relationship with Bitcoin here potentially around that. People were speculating that he might be selling potentially around that, too. But it's something that was top of mind for a lot of people here at the conference, including the first guest we had kicking us off today, the CEO of Celsius Network, Alex Mashinsky, weighing in on why crypto doesn't need Elon Musk. Once again, take a listen. ALEX MASHINSKY: The line is around the block. There's over 5,000 people trying to get in here this morning. So anyone who's worried about where Bitcoin is going just has to get an aerial shot of what's happening here in Miami. Like I said before, I don't think-- Elon is a tourist in crypto, right? He's here to collect followers. I don't think he's here to make the world a better place. And we can-- we're going to go to where we're going with Elon or without Elon. ZACK GUZMAN: Yeah, to be fair, you know, we've seen price movements around Elon Musk's tweets. So to say that he doesn't have any impact, obviously, wouldn't necessarily be true. But when you talk to people on the ground here at the Bitcoin conference, it is clear that a lot of people are digging more into the technology, the improvements we've seen, the adoption that we've seen, not just from retail investors, but institutional investors here as well.

So what, I guess, first of all, kind of want to talk about-- your initial reaction to this morning's print of, uh, non-farm payroll employment rising by 559,000 in the month of May. EVAN SOHN: Well, look, first of all, thank you very much for having me on your show. Uh, our index that we, uh, come out with every month, uh, we use as a predictor for what the job market's looking like. And we certainly saw the sentiment tick up from two months ago. So this month, it ticked up by 1 to 3.8 out of 5. We're really glad to see recruiter sentiment is higher. Of course, we're elated to see that people are getting hired again, um, though I'm still, uh, concerned that the numbers just aren't happening fast enough. And there are a lot of reasons that that's actually occurring. Some bright spots were things like seeing hospitality come back and those jobs, but we're really seeing-- over 40% of the recruiters that we surveyed, uh, commented that salaries are increasing from April to May, which is, again, part of the overall jobs numbers that you're seeing today. But there still is this incredible talent shortage in a number of areas, uh, people, uh, less likely to come back to work. And you're seeing companies now really shift around how to attract talent differently, whether it's signing bonuses, increase salaries, et cetera. - Evan, you see this from a vantage point the rest of us don't because of the-- the clients who use, um, Recruiter.com. So when we lose, for instance, the unemployment benefits in September that some people say are actually slowing down the return of people to jobs, do you think that's an accurate or potential explanation as to what we're seeing in these jobs numbers missing for now two months in a row?

2021-06-04T17:28:45.000Z,This meme stock exploded 62% in one day and this Wall Street analyst has had enough,"Hat tip to you, Bank of America analyst Curtis Nagle for adhering to some very basic principles of investing, which still matter even though meme stock traders couldn't care less about valuation methodologies, free cash flow outlooks or margin structures.  After seeing Bed Bath & Beyond (BBY) shares explode 62% on June 2, Nagle said in a research note on Friday that it's time for him step back from the volatile stock.  ""This [move in the stock] comes in the context of no significant updates from Bed Bath & Beyond or any other material news. Bed Bath & Beyond did release a press release on 6/2/21 regarding the launch of three new private label brands but this was already expected by investors and is not material, in our view. Instead we believe that the rapid appreciation in Bed Bath & Beyond's shares is being driven by another surge in interest and trading led by retail investors,"" Nagle said. ""This follows a very large but short-term move in late January of this year. We also note that Bed Bath & Beyond's share price increase corresponds to big moves over the past week with ""meme stocks"" such as GameStop, AMC and BlackBerry. As a result, we move to No Rating as we believe shares of Bed Bath & Beyond are no longer trading on fundamentals. Investors should no longer rely upon our previous investment opinion or price objective.""  Nagle isn't the first sell-side analyst this year to remove a rating or price target — or just outright drop coverage — of a company swept up into meme stock mania. Even still, as this former analyst could attest these are drastic actions that are far from the norm among the analyst community on Wall Street. It's a group that prides itself on making great calls after conducting granular research and maintaining good relationships with executive teams.   But the surprise maneuvers do underscore how impossible it is for an analyst to properly cover a company — which includes talking with management, modeling out future earnings and communicating those things to clients —amid an environment fast-filling up with a new generation of retail traders. In this topsy turvy backdrop, a veteran analyst could go from being a hero one day to being out of a job tomorrow simply because a CEO like Adam Aron of AMC conducts an interview with a YouTube influencer.

2021-06-04T16:39:27.000Z,"Meme stock mania: How much $1,000 would be worth now if you invested earlier","AMC and other meme stocks have dominated the news this week—and, really, most of the year. A flurry of individual investors, spurred on (in part) by Reddit’s r/WallStreetBets community, has sent share prices soaring in companies that Wall Street had largely forgotten. And plenty of people have seen substantial gains in a short period of time. The meme stock traders are largely of two camps: the day traders who ride the gains, then cash out quickly, and the long-term HODLers, the die-hards who see long-term potential in the stock. There’s all sorts of FOMO from other investors and lots of finger-wagging from fundamentalists who say the numbers can’t sustain these stock prices, but individual investors don’t seem to care much about what those groups have to say. What if, though, you were one of the early investors in three of the biggest meme stocks: [hotlink]GameStop[/hotlink], AMC, and Blackberry? How would your portfolio look today if you had bought and held? Here’s a look at what a $1,000 investment in the past could have been worth in the present. Dec. 20, 2013: GameStop and Blackberry had already been trading for years, but this is the first historical data available for AMC, so it’s as good a starting point as any. Your $1,000 in the theater chain would currently be worth $2,760. The same investment in GameStop would have fetched you $5,230. And a [hotlink]Best Buy[/hotlink] investor would have a portfolio worth $2,100. March 27, 2015: AMC shares were at a high of $34.95 as moviegoers flocked to see Home. Investors who bought then would see that investment now worth $1,610. GameStop was at $38.36 at the time, bringing the return to $6,760. And Blackberry was down to $9.46, and your $1,000 would be worth $1,600 today. Nov. 17, 2017: GameStop shares were well along their slow slide down from their 2015 peaks at this point, a descent that wouldn’t stop until this year. Shares were trading at $16.31. Your $1,000 would now be worth $15,940. Blackberry was on a bit of a rise, hitting $10.30, making the investment worth $1,490 today. And AMC was in a slump, hitting $12.95.

2021-06-04T18:29:51.000Z,Meme Stock Rally Puts Spotlight on Russell 2000 Index ReshuffleBloomberg,"(Bloomberg) -- A busy week for trading desks won’t end with the closing bell, at least for investors tracking FTSE Russell indexes. The index provider is set to announce preliminary changes after the close, and the Russell 2000 will take center stage with tweaks to the gauge of small-cap companies that over the past year have become not so small. That’s because of the surge in meme stocks like AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. and GameStop Corp. The average stock in the 2,000-member index, at $1.7 billion in market value, has grown about 50% since the last reshuffle a year ago. AMC, now the index’s heaviest-weighted member, has a market value that’s more than four times that of Silicon Laboratories Inc., the gauge’s largest member at last year’s reshuffle. The movie-theater chain has contributed the most to the Russell 2000’s rally this year after surging 2,300%, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Changes in sector weighting is another development to watch. Energy, which makes up less than 4% of the Russell 2000 Index, have more than doubled in value over the past year. Strategists at Jefferies expect the reshuffle to at least partly reflect that. Today’s announcement due after the bell won’t be final, as the index provider will make tweaks to the list of additions and deletions during the next week. The changes will take effect after the market close on June 25. Russell U.S. Index membership eligibility for the 2021 reconstitution is determined from published information and market capitalizations at market close of May 7, according to the index provider. At that point, AMC was worth $4.3 billion, well below Friday’s $26 billion level. FTSE Russell’s global stock indexes are used as benchmarks for about $16 trillion in assets, the company said in a statement during last year’s reconstitution. More than $9 trillion in investments track Russell indexes in the U.S., which include the Russell 1000 and Russell 2000.

Source: TY Lim / Shutterstock.com Reddit has been rallying shares all week long and boosting them higher in massive short squeezes. While some stocks are still on the rise, others appear to have run their course and are starting to fall back to previous levels. Let’s take a look at how some of the most popular Reddit stocks are performing on Friday. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) stock is still on the rise Friday with shares heading more than 2% higher as of this writing. Heavy trading also has some 187 million shares changing hands. For perspective, the stock’s daily average trading volume is about 131 million shares. GameStop (NYSE:GME) stock could be doing better today as shares decrease over 1% from yesterday’s close. The company has seen nearly 2 million shares traded today. That’s well below its daily average trading volume of 14.4 million shares. BlackBerry (NYSE:BB) stock is getting it the worst today with one of Reddit’s favorites falling over 5% as of this writing. That comes alongside heavy trading of the shares with some 104 million having changed hands. That’s more than the daily average trading volume of 28.6 million shares for the stock. While the meme stock rally might not continue, that doesn’t mean there aren’t other short squeeze targets to consider. Vinco Ventures (NASDAQ:BBIG) and Xeris Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:XERS) are both likely candidates for further short squeezes. You can learn more about them at these links. Of course, we’ve also got coverage of other stocks on the move Friday. Several companies are seeing shares move today and we’ve got the latest news.

2021-06-04T15:13:01.000Z,3 Most Heavily Shorted Stocks Primed for a Squeeze,"There are investors who follow very specific investment strategies. A good example is several investors or funds just focusing on initial public offerings. Similarly, I have seen investors who focus entirely on turnaround stories. In the recent past, there has been an army of Reddit users who have targeted heavily shorted stocks for a squeeze. This seems like another interesting strategy and has delivered results. The short squeeze rally in stocks like GameStop (NYSE:GME) and AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) will go down in the books of financial history. And I must mention here that GME stock looks primed for another squeeze. It’s also important to note that a short squeeze can be in stocks that are purely speculative. It can also be in stocks that seem fundamentally sound but have a near-term negative build-up. This column will focus on heavily shorted stocks that look good from a fundamental perspective. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips 7 Best Vaccine Stocks for Their Pipeline Potential Let’s talk about the reasons to be positive on these three heavily shorted stocks that look primed for squeeze. Skillz (NYSE:SKLZ) Airbnb (NASDAQ:ABNB) Petco Health and Wellness (NASDAQ:WOOF) Source: Rawpixel.com/Shutterstock.com With 30.8% of the free float shorted, ZKLZ stock is among the heavily shorted stocks. SKLZ stock has already corrected from highs of $46.3 to current levels of $17.0. It seems that the worst of the decline is over and the stock is primed for a squeeze. The markets have been concerned about Skillz’s growth. The company reported monthly active users of 2.7 million for the first quarter of 2021. On a year-on-year basis, MAUs were essentially the same. However, the company reported 92% revenue growth, which was driven by an 81% increase in monthly paying users. At the same time, the average revenue per user nearly doubled on a y-o-y basis. Therefore, there are several positives that can trigger stock upside.                     ",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-most-heavily-shorted-stocks-151301029.html

2021-06-04T20:22:15.000Z,AMC’s Dot-Com-on-Steroids Week Ends With More Dizzying GyrationsBloomberg,"(Bloomberg) -- True to form, AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. ended its wild week with another day of moves that confounded anyone trying to explain them. The new king of meme stocks bounced between gains and losses, closing 6.7% lower at $47.91 on Friday. It’s still up 83% on the week, adding to May’s 160% surge. It’s been quite a ride for AMC, with the stock’s surge enabling the world’s biggest movie-theater chain to sell equity and shore up its shaky balance sheet. On the brink of bankruptcy only a few months ago, the company is now the darling of retail traders, with this year’s 2,200% gain ranking as the most of any stock in the Russell 3000 Index. GameStop Corp., which started the meme-stock craze back in January, is a distant second with an advance of about 1,300%. “When does the bubble pop? I don’t know,” said Eric Handler, entertainment analyst at MKM Partners, who has a $1 target for AMC shares and sees no link between the current price and what’s actually going on at the company. “I have no idea when fundamentals will matter again.” Read more: AMC, Express Mark Golden Age for Retail-Focused Stock Sales Investors haven’t been deterred by the fact that AMC is still losing money, bleeding cash and facing a mountain of debt, as well as heavy competition. It seems a lot like the dot-com craze of two decades ago to Edward Moya, senior market analyst at Oanda Corp., “but on steroids -- the swings are greater and everything is happening in a much shorter time period,” he said. “What makes this trading environment crazier is that the retail trader has a better chance to hold their own against the big boys, now that they have low costs and have coordinated moves targeted with only a handful of stocks.” On Thursday, AMC tumbled 18% after disclosing plans to sell more stock. The company collected $587 million from the sale, which came just days after it netted $230.5 million by selling equity to Mudrick Capital Management. The company later said it is asking investors for permission to sell 25 million new shares in 2022, a 95% cut from a previous plan that was withdrawn because of shareholder opposition.

2021-06-04T10:49:10.000Z,"The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights: AMC Entertainment, Bed Bath & Beyond, GameStop, GrowGeneration and Micron","Chicago, IL – June 4, 2021 – Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. AMC, Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. BBBY, GameStop Corp. GME, GrowGeneration Corp. GRWG and Micron Technology, Inc. MU. AMC Entertainment shares soared nearly 100% Wednesday, while fellow so-called meme stocks Bed Bath & Beyond and GameStop jumped 60% and 13%, respectively. Despite these huge gains the broader market was far more subdued with all three major U.S. indexes up marginally on the day. The big meme moves occurred on another low volume day following the long Memorial Day weekend. The trading volume will likely remain far below average as summer begins and people start vacationing again. More cities around the U.S. are starting to reopen nearly completely amid the successful coronavirus vaccine push. The economic boom, coupled with the Fed's easy money policies, supply chain setbacks, government checks, and other factors have all contributed to rising prices that brought out inflation fears after April's 4.2% CPI figure was released. Clearly, rising prices must be monitored and Wall Street will be watching the Fed closely. But the central bank has continued to remain firm that inflation will be ""transitory."" Investors should also know that even if the Fed is forced to raise rates, yields will likely remain historically low, extending there is no alternative investing. For example, the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield has moved slightly above 3% only a few times in the last decade, after remaining well above the threshold in the pre-financial crisis world—it has hovered around 1.6% for much of the past three months.

""This is historic progress,"" Biden said in a speech. ""None of this success is an accident. It isn't luck.""    The Labor Department's closely watched employment report on Friday showed 559,000 nonfarm jobs created last month, with wages rising, though millions of unemployed Americans remained at home.    Economists polled by Reuters predicted even stronger job growth of 650,000 jobs created in May, and say the factors keeping people from working may include a lack of childcare and generous unemployment checks. Employment is about 7.6 million jobs below its peak in February 2020.    Rising wages are good for workers but threaten employers' profits and risk sparking paycheck-eating inflation.    ""May jobs report is good enough, but not great,"" concluded JPMorgan Chase & Co's Michael Feroli.    Republicans are pushing to cut the unemployment checks, with half of U.S. states, all led by GOP governors, cutting off billions of dollars in unemployment benefits for residents.    ""Biden and Democrats are holding back Americans from reentering the workforce and, therefore, holding back our economy,"" said Ronna McDaniel, chairwoman of the Republican National Committee.    An extra $300 in unemployment benefits was a key part of Democrats' stimulus plan enacted in March to help the United States survive the coronavirus recession.    Heather Boushey, a member of Biden's Council of Economic Advisers, said the White House is not pressuring states to take the money because ""labor markets are local.""    ""We always knew that jobs would start to come back as soon as we wrapped our heads around the pandemic, and those added benefits - many of them expire in September,"" she said. ""So it's just a couple more months now that people have access to them, and they provided a really important support for American families.""

2021-06-03T17:57:04.000Z,This is no longer our grandparents' or parents' stock market: strategist,"Love it or hate it, the Meme Market is back, and Wall Street strategists say it can’t be ignored. While shares of AMC Entertainment (AMC) are having a volatile Thursday, the social-media-fueled trading frenzy has pushed shares of AMC up nearly 3,000% this year, giving the money-losing movie theater chain a market value of more than $30 billion. AMC is not alone. Shares of Bed, Bath & Beyond (BBBY), Express (EXPR), and BlackBerry (BB) are all up this year. It’s reminiscent of the eye-popping run-up in shares of Gamestop (GME) that we saw back in January, when the Reddit investing crowd bought shares of the struggling video game retailer to stick it to the Wall Street pros who were betting against the stock. Ryan Nauman, market strategist at Zephyr told Yahoo Finance Live that wild trading in these so-called meme stocks is not so much a “threat” to the broader market as it is a “learning experience.” “This is no longer our grandparents’, or for that matter, our parents' stock market,” Nauman said. “Now, investment professionals need to start focusing more on looking at alternative data sets, rethinking their investment thesis to consider this growing cohort of retail investors.” Even if you’ve vowed to stay away from the “meme trading madness,” you may own AMC and GameStop and not even know it, because the stocks are still part of the Vanguard Russell 2000 Value Index Fund ETF Shares (VTWV). The recent rallies in those two stocks have pushed the Russell 2000 Value Index up 30% year-to-date, dusting the Vanguard Russell 2000 Growth Index Fund ETF Shares' (VTWG) 3.8% gain during the same period. “These retail investors, because of day trading, and for the most part, because of this virtually free money that we've had from the Fed since the pandemic, their voice is getting much larger due to social media,” Nauman said. “They need to be considered when we are coming up with the investment thesis moving forward.”         ",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/this-is-no-longer-our-grandparents-or-parents-stock-market-strategist-175704670.html

2021-06-03T17:25:03.000Z,Bed Bath & Beyond CEO Mark Tritton isn't getting sucked into meme stock mania,"This journalist remembers chatting on a number of occasions with Mark Tritton when he was the whiz kid behind Target's merchandising revival from 2016 to 2019.  Tritton — serving as Target's chief merchandising officer — was level-headed, decisive, creatively-focused and believed he could bring the cheap chic cool factor back to the discount retailer. He achieved his mission (Tritton remains a big reason why it's fun to shop at Target), and Target's bottom line continues to benefit from it to this day.  So I haven't been surprised to see Tritton run that same operational playbook since arriving as Bed Bath & Beyond's CEO (his first CEO job) in late 2019 to essentially save the home goods retailer from ruin.  Tritton quickly canned most of the terrible, long-tenured, under performing management team. He wasted no time to sell off non-core assets to raise a boatload of cash to fund a turnaround. He laid out long-term financial targets to Wall Street, and is delivering on them in a very volatile retail backdrop. Meanwhile, he is aggressively remodeling stores and totally overhauling the merchandise in them in a bid to regain customer loyalty.  Over time, Bed Bath & Beyond shareholders will likely be rewarded for these careful, well thought out efforts. Up to this point they have been: Bed Bath's stock has surged 155% since Tritton was named CEO on October 9, 2019. Worth noting, shares of Tritton's former employer Target are up 104% over that timespan.  Having said all of that, it's really no surprise I found Tritton keeping things in perspective at about 12:30 p.m. on June 2, 2021 in an interview on Yahoo Finance Live. Tritton stepped to the mic (remotely, still) as his stock price was up more than 40%, swept up once again into the meme stock mania being churned up by an army of retail traders.  ""I think today's activities are just a day in time. It doesn't affect us operationally. We are focused and ready,"" Tritton said. ""Regardless of the stock movement our role is to create sequential growth and strength at both the balance sheet and in growth ratios. We believe we have been doing that.""

ALEXIS CHRISTOFOROUS: Want to continue on with the markets now and bring in Brian Jacobsen. He is Multi Asset Strategist at Wells Fargo Asset Management. Brian, always good to see you. I want to stick with this meme theme here for a moment. Yesterday, we had a market strategist from Zephyr on who said, you know, like it or not, these retail investors who are sending some of these stocks into the stratosphere cannot and should not be ignored. What's your take on that? BRIAN JACOBSEN: Well, yeah, on my team, we agree. I mean, monitoring liquidity in markets, and seeing if there is excessive shorting of stocks, and seeing if there's going to be some sort of short squeeze-- to me, that's just sort of basics when it comes to portfolio management and trying to decide when it is that you're going to enter or exit a position. A lot of the portfolio managers that we work with, especially in the small cap space, were talking about how it is that over the last few months, because of the meme trade, that they've actually been able to take profits and exit some positions with some decent gains for our shareholders. And so they are a force to be reckoned with. But also keep in mind that what the swarm gives, they can also take, as you see with some of the volatility here. And so sometimes if the price moves and it's not an informational move, it might actually be prudent to take some profits on that. KRISTIN MYERS: So, then, it sounds like, Brian, you're saying that despite the fact that so many people are saying that, frankly, this is gambling, it's just out and out speculation, that there is money that you would be leaving on the table if you don't get involved in some of these trades with AME-- or AMC, excuse me, or GameStop, or Bed Bath and Beyond, or some of the others?

We have just about a minute to go to the bell. I want to bring into the stream first, David Nelson, Belpointe Wealth Management, and Sarah House. She's the Wells Fargo senior economist. But first, let's get to the markets here and see what the day's price action has in store for us. Now, the Dow is the laggard of the day. But it is up half a percent here. You can see that's good for 183 points. S&P 500 up 9/10 of a percent-- look like it's at session highs or close to it right now. And the NASDAQ, big outperform of the day, up nearly 1 and 1/2%. We'll get a check inside the NASDAQ 100 where we see the mega caps still holding onto some nice gains. Off their highs a little bit, but check out Microsoft, up 2%. Alphabet and Apple, just a little bit less than that. And what stands out is Tesla. Tesla's up 4 and 1/2%, pulling back some of those nasty losses it had in the rest of the big week. Also, look at Nvidia. That stock up 3 and 1/2% to another record high. And as we march towards that closing bell, just a quick look at the sector action for the day.

We have David Nelson and Sarah House here with us to break down the action that we saw not only in the markets side, but also what we've seen through econ data. David, let me send it over to you first, because when you take a look at the market's reaction, it looks like the market was satisfied with this report even though it came in slightly weaker than what the Street was initially expecting to see.

2021-06-03T16:08:31.000Z,10 Biggest Hedge Fund Failures,"In this article we are going to list the 10 Biggest Hedge Fund Failures. Click the following link to skip ahead and jump to the 5 Biggest Hedge Fund Failures. Before we start off with actual biggest hedge fund failures, let's take a step back and understand what a hedge fund is. Basically, a hedge fund is an investment fund from pooled resources which tends to trade in liquid assets while employing complex financial instruments in order to create better returns than the broader market, as well as hedging the risks of failure. Hedge funds are distinguished from other asset managers and funds precisely because of the type of investments they undertake. Additionally, hedge funds usually cater to high net-worth individuals and have very high investment requirements. Hedge funds make use of a wide variety of financial instruments to maximize the possible gain, with each hedge fund employing different tactics. And while they may sometimes be risky, hedge funds tend to provide a positive return on investment regardless of market downturn which is known as absolute return, and they are also considered to be of low risk as compared to retail funds with a high exposure to securities, because hedge funds employ, as the name suggests, hedging techniques to mitigate the risk. These funds generally charge a management fee, which is a small percentage of the net assets, as well as a performance fee. Image By peshkov - Adobe Stock While hedge funds have been around for decades, their popularity has recently started to grow substantially, with more and more people ready and willing to invest whatever savings they have. Hedge funds are a significant part of the financial market, with assets under management worth well over $3 trillion. Even during the pandemic, when markets across the world crashed as countries went into lockdowns because of the pandemic, the top hedge funds actually thrived. In this way, the 20 best performing hedge fund managers actually made $63.5 billion for their investors in 2020, which are the highest gains in a decade, and incredible news in a time where uncertainty has prevailed. However, this also shows the importance of selecting the right hedge fund, as the top 20 were responsible for 50% of all the gains made by the industry in one of the most turbulent of years. Nowadays, many hedge funds even use computers rather than human traders to make investments but 2020 showed that humans outperformed the computers in this regard.

2021-06-03T15:28:57.000Z,AMC embracing retail investors is 'rational': Strategist,"Interactive Brokers Chief Strategist Steve Sosnick joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss the latest outlook for meme stocks as AMC files to sell 11 million shares. - Let's bring in our first guest for the hour. We've got Steve Sosnick, Interactive Broker's chief strategist. Steve, I know you've been following this one really closely. There seems to be two camps here. You know, on the one hand you've got a company like AMC sort of acknowledging the wild swings they've seen in their stock, but addressing the retail traders through their program to try and keep the communication going. And then the others who say, this is just simply too risky because the fundamentals do not bear out the price it's trading at right now. How do you see the action? STEVE SOSNICK: Well, Akiko, that's a tricky, complex question. I think at some level you have both. I mean, I wrote a piece yesterday basically saying that it was clear that AMC was embracing the meme, and that it was thoroughly rational for them to do so. Because here you have a company that has billions of dollars in indebtedness. They-- you know, they suffered a huge hit during COVID, which we all understand, but prior to COVID they weren't making much money either. They had-- you know, they were more or less around flat line of earnings. They'd make money some quarters, give back money some others. The same with their cash flows. It's not a company that investors really would cater to in terms of that steady sort of income and cash flow growth that you would expect or want. So what can you do to get out of the situation you're in, with debt that's still trading, you know-- you know, basically with interest rates of 8% to 12%. The bond market's telling you, this is not a great company. And bond traders don't get caught up in hype the same way. They really only care about getting paid back, not about, you know, wild upside and volatility. And so I think that AMC said, we're going to embrace this. Bed Bath and Beyond, he's got a different point of view. But like it or not, all the meme stocks are sort of wrapped up in this weird thematic trade, you know, them and cryptos. And I think you see rotation.                 ",https://finance.yahoo.com/video/amc-embracing-retail-investors-rational-152857322.html

2021-06-04T20:39:15.000Z,Wall Street Versus Meme Army in AMC’s Big Share Price DivideBloomberg,"(Bloomberg) -- Wall Street analysts who typically drive price action in stocks have been relegated to the role of mere extras in the market drama surrounding AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. The movie theater operator’s dizzying stock rally has created a large divide between investors and Wall Street strategists as its share soared to $47.91, more than 800% above the average forecast of analysts covering the stock tracked by Bloomberg. That gap between the two is the biggest among U.S. stocks with a market cap of $1 billion or more. The situation shows how much meme stock investors have stolen the spotlight during the pandemic and the extent of the potential losses individuals and day traders will face -- if Wall Street turns out to be right. Retail investors may eventually “become bored of the slow growth trajectory of a mature business,” Alicia Reese, an analyst who covers the stock at Wedbush Securities, said in an interview. “But the fervor is high and appears to be rising so a precipitous fall does not seem imminent.” Read more: Day Traders Bet They Can Outsmart Wall Street’s Brightest on AMC Yet small-time investors have brushed past the advice of stock pundits who have been in the investing game for decades. The two worlds collided this week as AMC sold about 20 million shares capitalizing on its unlikely rally: New York-based Mudrick Capital bought 8.5 million shares from the company, helping to drive the rally, and quickly flipped them for a profit, telling clients the stock was overvalued.Then AMC collected $587 million in an 11.55 million share sale of an at-the-market offering on Thursday. The company last said it’s asking investors for permission to sell 25 million new shares in 2022. By Friday, volatility in AMC shares had spiked to a level not seen since the previous Reddit frenzy earlier this year. The stock gained 83% for the week, marking yet another win for small-time investors. Chief Executive Officer Adam Aron played to the crowd by encouraging day traders, while taunting bears. “Watch out naysayers, $AMC is going to play on offense again. Here we come!” he said in a Twitter post on Tuesday. A day later, AMC announced that it would reward small-time investors with goodies such as special screenings and free popcorn, feeding into the meme stock frenzy. And the next day, the company warned in a regulatory filing that they could see their stakes diluted and perhaps lose everything after the new offering.

2021-06-03T15:20:44.000Z,UK investors at risk as Brits pile into meme stock AMC,"UK investors have been piling into so-called meme stocks such as AMC (AMC) and Blackberry (BB) this week, despite being warned about high risks. According to figures from British trading company Freetrade, buy orders for AMC are up almost 300% on the week, and it is the most traded stock on the platform. Meanwhile, more than 63% of all new trades executed by UK traders on Capital.com in the past two weeks have been in financial derivatives linked to shares in AMC.  This is a significant jump from just 23% last month. Capital added that more than 82% of UK clients this week took a long position in the so-called meme stock. AMC was also the most purchased share on Hargreaves Lansdown, the biggest retail investment platform in the UK, over the past week with GameStop (GME) following closely behind.  It comes as AMC warned investors on Thursday not to ""buy our stock right now"", sending the price down as much as 30% before it pared back some losses. In a filing it said: ""We believe that the recent volatility and our current market prices reflect market and trading dynamics unrelated to our underlying business, or macro or industry fundamentals, and we do not know how long these dynamics will last. ""Under the circumstances, we caution you against investing in our Class A common stock, unless you are prepared to incur the risk of losing all or a substantial portion of your investment."" On Wednesday the cinema chain closed 95% higher on the day at $62.55 (£44.32), bringing its year-to-date gains to more than 3,000%. As of Wednesday’s close AMC had a market cap of $28bn, surpassing that of Delta Air Lines (DAL) and GameStop, the latter of which also joined the rally. Shares of Bed, Bath and Beyond (BBBY), Express (EXPR) and Koss (KOSS), which are all heavily shorted by Wall Street’s elite, were also caught up in the retail frenzy, all of which saw their share price rise more than 30% during the session.

In the same SEC filing, the movie chain also cautioned “against investing” in its common stock, unless investors “are prepared to incur the risk of losing all or a substantial portion” of their investment. JULIE HYMAN: But first, we got to talk about AMC, don't we? The company out with a surprise filing this morning, saying it's going to be selling 11 and 1/2 million additional shares, registering to sell them. But what really stood out to us, of course, from this filing was the language within it, and this quote in particular. ""Under the circumstances,"" reads the filing, ""we caution you against investing in our class A common stock, unless you're prepared to incur the risk of losing all or a substantial portion of your investment."" Now, it's not unusual to see sort of caveats, legalese in these types of filings. But even by those standards, this is fairly extraordinary. Here's a bunch more shares to buy. But you might not want to actually do that-- is an interesting move to take. Again, legally, I understand why they have to say it. But it's still pretty stark, Myles, when they actually do. MYLES UDLAND: Yeah. And you know, in addition to that-- and I would encourage viewers who are interested-- and I'm sure many already have-- I would encourage them to go read the rest of the filing. Because there are one, two, three, four, five additional bullet points of caveats on crazy things that have happened with shares of AMC and that may or may not happen to shares of AMC in the future. But again, I think it's quite a shrewd move here on the part of management to come to market for the second time in a week when you have this kind of action in your shares. And you know, I just put a post up on Yahoo Finance that a lot of the AMC bulls think is wrong. They're telling me to read the filing. I tell you to read the filing. The filing says there are 11 and 1/2 million new shares that can be issued. It is under the April prospectus, which has thus been amended today to include the additional shares. The 43 million shares they filed to sell in April, that sale was completed in May at, I believe, $9.94 per share or something like that. That's also a filing that you can then go read.                                   ",https://finance.yahoo.com/video/amc-files-sell-11-million-133033746.html

2021-06-03T12:15:27.000Z,AMC just dropped the hammer on every meme stock CEO,"The Meme Market is back with a vengeance.  And AMC (AMC) is playing a different game the second time around.  On Thursday morning, the company filed to sell up to an additional 11.5 million shares as its stock price continues a monster run higher.  On Wednesday alone AMC shares rose 95% and in pre-market trading on Thursday the stock was at one point up another 20%.  But this does not mark the company's first effort to capitalize on recent volatility.  Earlier this week AMC raised $230 million from Mudrick Capital in an offering the company said ""will allow us to be aggressive in going after the most valuable theatre assets, as well as to make other strategic investments in our business and to pursue deleveraging opportunities.""  On Wednesday, the company announced a new shareholder platform that will offer investors perks at actual movie theaters, including free popcorn. As we wrote in Thursday's Morning Brief, a company's stock is its currency and AMC is currently using a sharp rise in the value of this currency to improve its actual business.  And with all these moves, AMC CEO Adam Aron and the whole executive team at the company are putting the pressure on their peers running other companies caught up in the meme trade to not just let this market moment come and go. These are episodes that management teams must cash in on.  Back in the winter when GameStop (GME) was the focal point of the first meme stock rally that management team sat on its hands for months. And now GameStop is in the process of looking for a new CEO.  And while the rally in AMC and other meme names right now might not make sense, from the vantage point of a management team that tries to create value for shareholders the way to respond to this interest is clear: you sell stock until the market can't take it anymore.  AMC's filing on Thursday also does not obligate the company to sell additional shares now or at any time. It merely allows AMC to reserve the right to sell stock.

2021-06-03T10:26:41.000Z,Meme Stock Craze Reaches New Heights as AMC Keeps Surging,"(Bloomberg) -- “AMC to the Moon” posters are popping up at street corners and pool parties in the U.S. in yet another sign of the retail frenzy over meme stocks. After a reality-defying surge on Wednesday, the stock is skyrocketing once again. The shares added 20% to $74.85 in U.S. pre-market trading. AMC now has a market value of more than $30 billion, making it bigger than at least half of the companies in the S&P 500 Index. The latest meme stock frenzy appears to have greater momentum behind it than GameStop Corp. back in January, and the reasons are just as unclear. Some analysts point to an abundance of liquidity and savings created during the pandemic. Others cite the impact of social media in providing a platform for small investors to egg each other on. “AMC and meme stocks are somewhat the modern and accelerated version of tulip bulbs frenzy in the 17th century,” said Sylvain Goyon, a Paris-based strategist at Oddo BHF. “The shares rise with the hype and die without it.” Other retail favorites were also on a tear. BlackBerry Ltd. soared 39% in premarket Thursday, while Workhorse Group Inc. jumped 26%. AMC’s rally has been remarkable both in terms of its speed and extent. Just a few short months ago, the company was on the brink of bankruptcy as the pandemic shuttered cinemas across the U.S. What’s more, the outlook for the cinema industry remains littered with challenges. As of Wednesday’s close, AMC stock had risen almost 30-fold since the start of this year, far exceeding GameStop’s 15-fold increase. “Fundamentally, AMC is not a flourishing business, or at least not right now,” said Ipek Ozkardeskaya, a senior analyst at Swissquote. “There is a little chance that the actual and future business environment would ever justify a $33 billion worth of market capitalization unless there is an incredible innovation in the movie theater business that no one’s heard of, and which would change the face of the business moving forward.”       ",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/meme-stock-craze-reaches-heights-102641325.html

Subscribe Thursday, June 3, 2021 When the market moves at the speed of AMC (AMC) it can be hard to keep up.  But all we can tell readers for sure is that the Meme Market is back.  On Wednesday alone, AMC shares nearly doubled, rising 95% to close at a record $62.55. AMC's market cap is now just north of $28 billion. Since the beginning of May, AMC stock is up more than 500%. Year-to-date, shares have gained about 3,000%.  The superlatives can go on. AMC was not alone, however. Shares of Bed, Bath & Beyond (BBBY), Express (EXPR), and BlackBerry (BB) all rose more than 30% on Wednesday. Even our old friends at GameStop (GME) got involved, rising some 13% amid a broad rally in meme names widely discussed on reddit and elsewhere.  But after the GameStop saga of mid-winter came and went, the market's energy moved into areas like NFTs and cryptocurrencies. Dogecoin (DOGE-USD) became a better indicator of risk sentiment than the VIX. In the background of all this the major U.S. stock indexes were treading water, minding their own business as the economy continued to rebound from last year's recession.  Along the way, the Morning Brief highlighted survey data from Deutsche Bank published in late February that suggested retail traders had no plans to leave the market. In April, fund flow data from Bank of America showed retail investors were still buying stocks while institutions were lightening up on their equity exposure.   A redux of this winter's full-on meme market, however, seemed unlikely.  And yet here we are.  The differences between the winter's GameStop episode and the present mania, of course, are many.  There has not yet been the emergence of a broad ""Wall Street vs. Main Street"" dynamic quite yet. Self-promotors from the world of tech, and crypto, and sports betting haven't inserted themselves into the present conversation with the same enthusiasm as was seen back in February.

2021-06-03T05:37:49.000Z,"AMC Set For New Records, Up 20% Premarket, Blackberry Gains 30%","By Dhirendra Tripathi Investing — Meme stock favorite AMC (NYSE:AMC) looked set for another blockbuster run Thursday, rallying 20% in the premarket, a day after shares more than doubled in a single session. BlackBerry (NYSE:BB) was up too, rising 30% in premarket, while GameStop (NYSE:GME), the original meme stock darling, gained 3%, in line with its relatively subdued trend in recent times. The meme stock rally has been driven by by retail inventors acting together to bid up shares of heavily shorted companies, forcing short sellers to unwind their bets at a loss. AMC has done much more recently beyond offering free popcorn to investors who sign who sign up for its AMC Investor Connect, an initiative to engage directly with its sizable retail shareholders, to attract attention but this demolition of trading records and stock market highs has left many baffled. In less than a month, AMC has raised $658.5 million in equity. Part of this money will be spent on new leases and revamping old theatres. But the pandemic has caused its long-term debt levels to soar to $5.4 billion as of the first three months of this year from less than $2 billion in 2016. And it’s still losing money, with analysts expecting another $100 million to go over the next 12 months. Many experts have warned that retail traders, who are looking for quick money, could end up hurting themselves as the fundamentals of the companies aren’t strong enough to justify current valuations.

2021-06-02T23:25:11.000Z,"Move Over Gamestop, AMC Entertainment Options are now Where the Action is.","Earlier in 2021, we saw some pretty incredible trading in the shares and options of video-game retailer Gamestop (GME) when the stock went from $10/share all the way to $483, fueled by the trading of the Reddit community in Wallstreetbets who correctly sniffed out big short interest and then caused (or simply exacerbated) a short squeeze. After falling back to the $40 level, Gamestop shares have risen all the way back to over $280 recently. It’s no longer the hottest stock with the meme-traders, however. Right now that title belongs to the shares of movie theater operator AMC Entertainment (AMC). Starting the year at $2 and rising all the way to $20 during that Gamestop rally in January, AMC shares mostly flatlined for the next few months before starting another steep rise. On Wednesday, AMC shares nearly doubled in a single session, rising 95% to close at $62.55. Trading volumes are huge. 50-100% of the float of AMC is trading hands each day lately – a clear indication that there’s more than simply a short squeeze at work here. Options volumes are even more incredible. On Wednesday 4.6 million AMC contracts changed hands. That’s more than 10% of all the 42 million equity options traded in the entire market! Implied volatilities are unbelievably high. June options traded near 500% IV on Wednesday. Similar to a situation we saw in Gamestop earlier in 2021, buyers of the 46-day at-the-money 65 strike straddle were paying $65. At that price, a seller has no downside risk (because the shares can’t go below zero) and only loses on the upside if the stock more than doubles in value. With those kinds of share price moves and premium levels, you might be considering diving into the AMC options market. Before you do, let’s reconsider the concept of “gamma squeeze.” It’s what happens when traders buy a large number of calls on a stock that’s rising. A trader who buys 100 shares for $62 each needs to shell out $6,200 to fund the purchase and faces the potential of losing that entire amount if the share price goes to zero. That same trader can buy a short-term out-of-the-money call option for about $10, limiting maximum risk to just $1,000, but also participating in a rally to the upside. That’s an attractive proposition for someone who has a significant portion of their investible assets in a single trade.

2021-06-02T20:45:18.000Z,Analyst: AMC will eventually fall back to projected price below $10,"Wedbush Securities Equity Research Analyst Alicia Reese explains what could happen next in AMC's volatile rise. SEANA SMITH: We want to talk about one of the huge movers in the market today. And that, of course, was AMC. Shares closing up just over 100%, hitting an all-time high earlier today of 72.62 a share. So to help us make sense or try to make sense, I should say, of some of the action that we've seen lately in this name, we want to bring in Alicia Reese. She is of Wedbush Securities. And Alicia, this crazy surge that we've seen in this stock recently, it's not only AMC, but it's been a number of the meme stocks. But first, let's focus on AMC. You cover this stock. Help us make sense, or I guess, what's your big takeaway of the recent action that we've seen in this name? ALICIA REESE: Well, it's not based on fundamentals. So it's not something we can predict as closely as we have been able to predict it in the past. Looking at the fundamentals, it would normally trade between 7 and 9 times 23 consensus EBITDA. Right now, it closed at 43, 44 times that. The enterprise value has more than doubled since yesterday. And that was extremely high, compared to where it's normally trading. So we have a pretty big disparity. When that comes down or whether that stays up or continues to rise is your guess is as good as ours. ADAM SHAPIRO: So, you know, you deserve credit because in your note of May 24, you actually said to your clients-- and I'm going to quote you-- we do not recommend buying shares of AMC here, as we think its share price no longer reflects its fundamentals, elevated by retail investors whose time horizons for holding are unclear. I mean, that's almost two weeks ago. And yet, we've seen a surge in that two-week period. Is there-- it's almost as I want to say, there's some nefarious entity that's pushing these perhaps less skilled retail investors to take on risk that they're just not prepared for what could be a very big loss.

2021-06-02T20:33:29.000Z,"Market Recap: Wednesday, June 2","Stocks hugged the flat line Wednesday afternoon on the heels of a mixed session a day earlier, with the three major indexes struggling for direction ahead of key economic data reports later this week. Michael Hans, Chief Investment Officer at Clarfeld Citizens Private Wealth and Steven Blitz, US Economist at TS Lombard joined Yahoo Finance Live to discuss. [MUSIC PLAYING] SEANA SMITH: Just around three minutes here until the closing bell. All three major averages barely holding on to gains. We have Michael Hans, Chief Investment Officer at Clarfield Citizens Private Wealth. And we're also joined by Steven Blitz, US economist at TS Lombard. Michael, let me start with you. Taking a look at the action today, not a heck of a lot of movement in the major indices. When you take a look at the sector action though, energy once again the big leader. What do you make of the gains that we're seeing today? MICHAEL HANS: I think what you're seeing, and it's not just today, it's been the last several trading sessions, the indices themselves, as you mentioned correctly, haven't moved a tremendous amount. And I think the focus now is on what's that next catalyst and direction of the marketplace. And I think the overall focus is going to be for more resumption of what worked in Q4 and earlier on in Q1, namely the value cyclicality and smaller capitalization. And that's seen maybe broadening out. But catalyst is ultimately going to be what direction the Fed moves in and when. ADAM SHAPIRO: Michael, very, very quick follow on that, and Steven, we're going to get to you, but we got the bell coming up. When you talk about the Fed moving, I mean, the minutes we saw that there's ramped up, perhaps we need to start talking about talking about tapering, right? MICHAEL HANS: Yeah, absolutely, and we talk to our clients all the time. We don't anticipate the Fed raising rates anytime soon. But a tremendous amount happens between buying over $100 billion of securities a month and ultimately raising rates. And ultimately from the perspective of overall stimulus, at the margin we are going to downshift. It's probably not going to happen in the upcoming meeting. I think they're going to really need to see multiple labor reports, as Chair Powell has indicated. But that's really going to be a substantive driver of the back end of this year.

2021-06-02T19:23:10.000Z,AMC shares jump 100pc after offering free popcorn to investors,"The promise of free popcorn for investors helped shares in US cinema chain AMC to more than double on Wednesday as the online Reddit community behind the Gamestop phenomenon enthusiastically backed the company. AMC - which owns hundreds of US cinemas and Odeon, Europe’s largest operator - saw shares rise to an all-time high, with trading repeatedly halted. They rose by as much as 115pc, with the company valued at more than $30bn (£21bn) at one point. It came as AMC said it would give perks to its 3.2m investors, including free popcorn when they come to see movies during the summer, in what it said was a “groundbreaking new approach to investor relations”. It added that shareholders would also gain access to special screenings and discounts. AMC has recently overtaken video game seller Gamestop as the most prominent stock on Reddit’s Wall Street Bets, a community of amateur traders who use free trading apps such as Robinhood to take on Wall Street investors. The company’s value has now climbed by more than 3,000pc this year, despite revenues falling by 84pc year-on-year in its most recent quarter, as cinemas are shut or suffer from reduced attendance during the pandemic. Like Gamestop, online investors have backed the company in part due to substantial levels of short selling, with traders believing they can engineer a “short squeeze” that pushes up shares as sceptics are forced to close their positions.

ALEXIS CHRISTOFOROUS: A frenzy of buying of AMC stock triggered several trading halts today, with meme stock traders fueling a surge in that stock of more than 100%. The manic trading activity comes despite a report that a hedge fund had sold its stake in the movie theater company. Here to talk about those meme stocks and the market at large is Ryan Nauman, Market Strategist at Zephyr. Ryan, good to have you here. I want to start with the activity we're seeing in AMC today. We're also seeing a little bit of that bleeding over into Bed Bath and Beyond, another so-called meme stock. How much of a threat is this kind of trading to the broader stock market? RYAN NAUMAN: Alexis, first, thank you so much for having me on. It's such a fascinating question. And really, you know, it's been a fascinating story this whole year are the meme stocks. And to me, I don't know if it's so much of a threat to the markets. It's more of a learning experience. And my biggest takeaway from this year is that this is no longer our grandparents', or for that matter, our parents' stock market. Now, investment professionals, they need to start focusing more on looking at alternative data sets, you know, rethinking their investment thesis to consider this growing cohort of retail investors. These retail investors, because of day trading, and for the most part, because of this virtually free money that we've had from the Fed since the pandemic, that their voice is getting much larger due to social media, and they need to be considered when we are coming up with the investment thesis moving forward. And that's what we're seeing with AMC. AMC, the executives there, they're rewarding this retail cohorts with perks due to their fantastic run this year. I think they're up nearly 1,400% year to date, and they're getting rewarded for it. That's what we're going to see moving forward. And investment theses need to consider that moving forward.           ",https://finance.yahoo.com/video/no-longer-grandparents-parents-stock-180120465.html

MYLES UDLAND: All right. Let's stay on the markets here and talk a bit more about everything happening in markets these days. Matt Maley joins us now. He's Managing Director and Equity Strategist over at Miller Tabak. So Matt, let's start with the meme names. And we were talking about it at the beginning of the show, and I know you've watched a lot of these trends within the markets evolve. You've watched them very closely over time. And we continue to see this as a feature of the market. As you talk to institutional clients and others, is this something that continues to come up, or are folks sort of letting these dogs lie over to the side? MATT MALEY: Yeah, on the institutional side, they really are letting the dogs lie. It's something that people-- and I agree with them-- do not see a long-term fundamental backdrop for a stock like AMC to be trading where it's trading right now. And we've seen what's happened in the past. Obviously, with this stock in particular, but also with, obviously, GameStop a couple of months ago. And even with one-- again, these stocks with these high short interest levels and they shoot up. The same thing happened with Viacom. I mean, this stock went down 63% in a day and a half a few months ago-- not even, just a couple of weeks ago. So this is, I think, a similar thing that we're looking at with AMC. It's the greater fool theory at these levels. It doesn't mean it's a bad company. It's just like a stock. I mean, you have a great company, like a Amazon or Apple, they're great companies. But sometimes their stocks get out of line, they get too far ahead of themselves, and they see a correction. And so I'm not saying that AMC's going to go belly up. But when a stock goes that far that fast and really no fundamental-- I mean, you're just guessing and hoping that they can turn things around many years from now, it's not one I want to chase. And talking to these institutional players, they don't they don't want to really play in this game right here.

2021-06-02T13:15:01.000Z,GameStop boosts teen interest in investing - survey,"By Sinéad Carew (Reuters) - While traders were flocking to GameStop earlier this year, the stock was also capturing the imagination of U.S. teenagers, according to a survey from Wells Fargo. A third of teens say they are learning financial lessons from the internet and social media, according to the survey of 13 to 17 year olds and parents of teenagers. And almost half of the teens say they are more interested in investing thanks to GameStop, whose shares have surged due to its popularity among members of online investor forums. The survey follows Fidelity Investments' launch earlier this month of a commission-free brokerage account for 13- to 17-year-olds that allows stock trading on a mobile app, as it looks to attract the next generation of investors. The survey of 318 teens and 304 parents of teens conducted between April 20 and May 3, found that while 57% of teens say they are learning about finances from their parents and 47% say they are learning from school, 35% cite social media and 34% cite websites. But parents had a different take with only 12% saying their teens use social media for financial education. About 45% of teens said ""the GameStop social media situation"" boosted their interest in investing with 53% of boys claiming increased interest and 40% of teen girls, according to Wells Fargo. As for cryptocurrency, 50% of parents say their teen knows more about bitcoin than them. However, while 58% of teen boys say they know more about bitcoin than their parents, only 33% of teen girls claimed to be more knowledgeable. Still actual investing rates seemed much smaller with 17% of parents saying they opened custodial accounts to invest on their teen’s behalf. About 13% encouraged their teen to play a simulated stock game. About 7% gave their teen stocks for educational purposes. However, only 20% of teens say their parents engaged with them on these activities, Wells said.

2021-06-02T05:48:41.000Z,"Meme Stocks Surge Premarket, AMC Ignores Mudrock Exit For One More Pop","By Dhirendra Tripathi Investing — Meme stocks AMC (NYSE:AMC) and BlackBerry (NYSE:BB) posted double digit gains in premarket Wednesday, as the craze for them refuses to die. AMC was up 32%, on track to open at a record high, while Blackberry (TSX:BB) added 19% and the original darling, GameStop (NYSE:GME) rose 5%. Tuesday’s exit of Mudrock Capital Management from AMC, within a few hours of putting in $230.5 million equity in the multiplex operator, seemed of little significance as its shares seemed set for another blockbuster day. The company will use the cash proceeds to revamp its existing outlets and create more leases. Investor interest in the stock has also heightened as people set out to shop and visit theatres and restaurants after being holed up home for a year. The company has raised $658.5 million equity through two separate exercises in less than a month. AMC, GameStop and Blackberry, have been at the center of an almost six-month-long battle with retail traders on one side and hedge funds and other big institutions on the other. While the big boys have been short on the stock, the small retail traders, using various chat applications and social media chat platforms like Reddit to coordinate their action, have come together to cause a short squeeze on the stocks – a phenomenon where the stock begins to rise against an expected fall, causing losses to those who were positioned to trade on the fall. AMC last week replaced GameStop as the favorite of the Reddit gang, according to Bank of America findings. Many experts have warned that the small savers, who are looking for quick money, could end up hurting themselves as the fundamentals of the companies aren’t strong enough to justify those valuations. The warnings have made little difference as the stocks have mostly maintained their elevated levels, in AMC’s case still making new highs.

2021-06-01T21:29:38.000Z,"AMC, GameStop Rallies Deal Shorts Another $848 Million Blow","(Bloomberg) -- AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. and GameStop Corp.’s stock rallies Tuesday hammered short sellers to the tune of $848 million, deepening bears’ horrific 2021 losses. The movie theater operator’s 23% surge handed shorts $536 million in mark-to-market losses, while the video-game retailer’s 12% rally dealt another $312 million blow, according to financial analytics firm S3 Partners. Their meteoric gains have squeezed short sellers with losses ballooning to about $9.25 billion in total for investors betting against both companies this year, Ihor Dusaniwsky, S3’s managing director of predictive analytics, said in an email. The two stocks, which have become icons for retail traders using social media platforms to power shares higher, came even after AMC sold $230.5 million worth of shares to Mudrick Capital. The money manager was said to then flip that investment at a profit just hours after unveiling the bet. Mudrick called AMC’s share price overvalued, according to a person with knowledge of the matter, as institutional investors continue to see the movie theater company as an easy stock to trade but not one to invest in for the long-haul. Read more: Mudrick Said to Sell Entire AMC Stake, Calling Shares Overvalued AMC short sellers have actually increased their exposure by roughly 3 million shares over the last month, according to Dusaniwsky, while GameStop shorts have slowly been covering their positions over that same time period.

2021-06-04T15:25:39.000Z,Concerns about returning to work will ‘ease over time’: EconomistYahoo Finance Video,"The U.S. added 559,000 jobs in the month of May. BofA Securities US Economist Joe Song joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss. ADAM SHAPIRO: OK, let's break down what these numbers mean for investors and for the economy. We bring into the stream Joe Song. He's Bank of America Securities US economist. It's good to have you here. And just headline numbers here. What is your reaction? Because it is a miss on the expectation. And we also saw the unemployment rate fall. But that's more of a factor of people dropping out of the workforce. So how do you interpret this? JOE SONG: It was a miss, but it was still, like, good jobs report. You know, 559,000 jobs created in May. I think market participants are currently breathing a sigh of relief, especially after the very weak April jobs report we got last month. So it does suggest that the labor market recovery is on track. And we are seeing better pace in job gains. That said, heading into this year, we had very lofty expectations for job creation, especially in the spring, as the reopening process really took hold. Forecasters, us included, were expecting roughly a million jobs created per month. And we're falling well short of that. And I think the big story there is that we are seeing supply constraints, like all across the economy right now, as every part of the economy is starting to reopen. JULIA LA ROCHE: You know, Joe, let's explore that further when you're talking about you all had these higher expectations coming in. And we're talking about the story of supply constraints. What do you think might change the needle? Or how does that kind of reframe your outlook going forward? JOE SONG: Yeah, it tells us that this labor market recovery is going to trudge along. It's going to take a little more time than what we had previously anticipated. You know, we're thinking, you know, we should see a big spurt of job growth early on and then kind of subside from there. But just, it could be a more gradual ramping up of job creation, especially through the fall and winter. And the big story I think right now is, there's multiple things going on.

The move by Mudrick Capital Management to flip 8.5 million shares of the movie theater chain immediately after buying them in a private placement from the company shows how Wall Street is getting bolder about making a quick buck off a trading frenzy that has helped fuel big rallies in several stocks favored by retail investors. Easy money from the Federal Reserve has ""created an almost video game-like atmosphere in the stock market and investing,"" said Michael O'Rourke, chief market strategist at Jones Trading. ""There's money flowing everywhere and this is a great illustration of that."" AMC said earlier Tuesday it issued https://sec.report/Document/0001104659-21-074526 8.5 million shares to Mudrick, the chain's latest share sale this year as it cashes in on a big jump in its stock in 2021. Mudrick has sold its AMC stake at a profit, believing the company's shares are overvalued, the source familiar with the matter said on Tuesday. Additional details could not be immediately determined. AMC did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Mudrick's divestiture reported earlier by Bloomberg News. AMC said it would invest the proceeds in its existing theaters, which are set to benefit from a recovery in demand as more states lift COVID-19 restrictions on social gatherings. ""This can be a real way for AMC to grow again, creating immediate value for AMC shareholders,"" Chief Executive Adam Aron wrote in a Twitter thread https://twitter.com/CEOAdam/status/1399683077660721152. ""This is not mindless dilution, but rather this is very smart raising of cash so that we can grow this company.""

2021-06-01T07:30:42.000Z,"AMC Pops After Latest Fund Raise, Other Meme Stocks Are Partying Too","By Dhirendra Tripathi Investing — Another week but it was business as usual for meme stocks as the likes of AMC (NYSE:AMC), GameStop (NYSE:GME) and BlackBerry (NYSE:BB) were up again in premarket Tuesday. AMC, the latest top draw for the Reddit crowd after replacing GameStop in the league, was up 8%. Blackberry (TSX:BB), a relatively new entrant, was up 7% while the video games retailer was up 3%. In the case of AMC, there was some news too. The theatre chain said it has raised $230.5 million from sale of 8.5 million Class A Common stock at approximately $27.12 per share. This is AMC’s second big fund raise in less than three weeks. It had then raised $428 million via sale of 43 million shares at $9.94 apiece. Since the May 13 announcement, the shares have trebled below closing a trifle lower Friday. The story mostly began in January, when some Reddit followers decided to take on the big hedge funds who were short on GameStop. That unexpected coming together of widely distributed retail investors resulted in a short squeeze in the stock and created trouble for the institutional traders. One even went under. Since then, the battle between the big institutional guys and the small retail traders, large number of whom are on Robinhood, has waged on. There was a lull in between but last few weeks have brought back the invisible fight between the small, mostly young, retail traders and the big boys. In the process, all doomsday projections of small investors burning themselves have come to naught as meme stocks stay at elevated levels.

2021-05-28T20:04:09.000Z,AMC surpasses $12B market cap as Redditor asks if it can go 'to the moon',"Shares of AMC Entertainment (AMC) surged over 45% in afternoon trading Thursday, pushing the market capitalization of the country's largest theater chain past $12 billion amid a boost from retail investors. At market close on Thursday, AMC was still up over 35% with a market value of just $11.94 billion. On Friday morning at 8:30 a.m. EDT, shares were up nearly 12% in pre-market trading and up 22% after the market open at 9:45 a.m. EDT. The stock fell in midday trading and was down 2% as of 1:20 p.m. EDT.  The stock was down 1.4% at market close on Friday. AMC, which narrowly avoided bankruptcy earlier this year, belongs to a class of so-called meme stocks including GameStop (GME) and Bed Bath and Beyond (BBBY). Retail investors active on the subreddit WallStreetBets have crowded into stocks of these underdog companies in an effort to force short sellers to buy them to cover their positions. This squeeze on short sellers drives the stock prices even higher. Brick-and-mortar video game retailer GameStop, the most notable meme stock, soared over 15% on Wednesday and added another 5% on Thursday. Retail traders on WallStreetBets talked up AMC on Thursday, with one calling the theater a ""rocket ship,"" another urging fellow Redditors ""don't sell!"" and still another asking if it ""can go to the moon?"" Shares of the theater chain closed at $26.52 on Thursday, up from around $14 on May 17, when they were also rallying. The chain fell below $2 at the start of the year, a few weeks before it received a $917 million cash boost from investors to help it stave off bankruptcy. Taking advantage of the recent gains, AMC said earlier this month that it had sold 43 million shares at $9.94 a share, raising a total of $428 million. That move came as the hashtag ""AMCsqueeze"" began trending on Twitter. Last week, Chinese real-estate conglomerate Wanda Group, which had been AMC's largest shareholder, cashed in on the recent rally by selling most of its shares in AMC.

2021-05-28T19:14:08.000Z,"AMC, Gamestop: Meme stocks roar back, fueled by Reddit-inspired traders","In January 2021, the rise of retail investing and the subreddit r/WallStreetBets sparked a broader speculative movement in a few stocks that ended up disrupting trading at brokerages and culminating in a Congressional hearing. And after a relatively quiet few months, the so-called meme stocks are back in a big way. The movement's mascot, GameStop (GME), ended the week up 23.6%. (Analysts from Vanda Research said that this was likely due to institutional involvement rather than a big retail push.) And the new meme stock leader is AMC (AMC), which has taken over the narrative with an enormous 108.9% gain for the week. AMC's stock was even up as much as 160% at certain points, with its market cap cresting an unbelievable $12 billion after almost going bankrupt earlier this year. The stock even broke call-volume records. The latest boom in meme stocks echoes early 2021, when reddit users and a scattered group of stock-trading enthusiasts managed to drive the narrative on various stocks and drive prices significantly as the hype increased. (In the case of GameStop, Keith “Roaring Kitty” Gill, the architect of GameStop’s bull case, convinced many people.) This extremely online community recently turned to talking up AMC, openly wondering about sending it “to the moon.” The stock was at $2.01 at the beginning of the year and is up over 1,200% to $26.  In the first meme stock frenzy, AMC went as high as $19 before falling to a relatively stable range of between $5 and $9. (For meme stocks, those enormous swings are small.) Another element of the meme stock story still remains: the war against shorts.  Conspiracy theories abound around companies selling meme stocks short, often without owning them, a practice called “naked” short selling, which is not allowed but can still happen. This week, a campaign to squeeze potential shorts once again emerged with #AMCSqueeze trending on Twitter. While Koss (KOSS) and GameStop saw similar action on Friday — one meme stock action appears to rally the basket — AMC’s rally coincides with the chain starting to reopen theaters, a sector that had obviously been badly hit by the pandemic.

2021-05-28T18:39:11.000Z,A Strange GameStop: The Only Winning Move Is Not to Play,"The meme stock phenomenon seemed like it was over and done with. But, as seen from the latest movement from GameStop (NYSE:GME) stock, it’s not over just yet. Looking to beat the so-called “smart money” at their own game once again, retail investors, such as those active on Reddit’s r/WallStreetBets subreddit, are back in the game of bidding up their old favorites. Source: quietbits / Shutterstock.com Sure, another Reddit favorite, AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC), is benefiting the most from the rally right now. Its opening price on May 28 was higher than it’s been in four years, over 50% higher than its late-January peak. Shares in GME stock, the video game retailer with e-commerce aspirations, are still far from returning to their high water mark. But at that opening price of around $263 per share, an investor who bought at May 10’s $143.22 close would see their shares gain more than 80%. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips 7 Best Stocks for Upcoming Grads to Buy and Hold Forever So, should you hop aboard in the hopes that GME stock gets squeezed back to $483 per share? Or should you ignore the hype and go short as it trades well above GameStop’s underlying value? How about a third option? To paraphrase the film WarGames, the only winning move with GameStop is not to play. All bets are off on which direction shares will go next. Too risky to buy, and too risky to short, it’s best to steer clear of this latest GME stock roller coaster. What’s sparking the renewed interest in shares of both GameStop and AMC? The same thing that kicked off the initial round of volatility: short squeezing. As the meme stock trend cooled in the spring, hedge funds may have thought the coast was clear. Moving on from their winter losses, investors got back into the game, initiating or maintaining short positions in these overheated names that started to cool off. But the “smart money” investors again underestimated the Reddit set and are now paying the price. Starting in mid-May, online chatter about both names spiked. Realizing Wall Street was putting itself in a vulnerable position, users on investment subreddits started putting the squeeze on them a second time.

2021-05-28T18:35:00.000Z,AMC Flywheel Effect Hits a Snag Despite Record Call Volume,"(Bloomberg) -- An attempted gamma squeeze by Reddit-inspired traders on AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. quickly unraveled as shares in the movie theater operator turned lower Friday. This week’s scorching surge looked to have been fueled in part by a massive push into bullish options. When there’s a run on calls during a rapid stock rally, it can force additional stock-buying in a potential feedback loop. But by Friday afternoon, the stock’s gains had been significantly pared back. A record 2 million AMC calls were purchased on Thursday as the stock soared 36%. And then on Friday when the stock opened 20% higher, another 2 million calls were bought by 2 p.m. The shares last traded up 3.3% after briefly turning negative earlier. The traders’ gamma hedging may not have had a lasting flywheel effect due simply to the fact that the U.S. is facing a three-day weekend, and most of the enthusiasm around AMC is coming from day traders, according to Susquehanna International Group. “Once the rally was underway, the increase in option volume exacerbated the momentum,” Susquehanna co-head of derivatives strategy Chris Murphy said. However, “All of this trading is very short-term, so a three-day weekend is like an eternity.” AMC was also caught in the initial day-trader frenzy earlier this year, which swept up the likes of GameStop Corp. to dizzying heights as retail investors mobilized. Now another surge in retail trading has emerged with AMC as the main focus: #AMCSTRONG has been trending on Twitter, and it was the most-cited company on the forum Stocktwits for four consecutive days this week. Earlier this year options were also a compounding factor in January’s meme-stock frenzy, with all-time high levels of GameStop calls bought. Bullish contracts on AMC had also reached a record in February, which has now been dwarfed by the current levels. “You can’t have people buy 2 million call options on an almost bankrupt stock without making it go up,” said Benn Eifert, chief investment officer of QVR Advisors. “Dealers were short a lot of gamma and bought stock, accelerating the rally.”   ",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amc-flywheel-effect-hits-snag-183500234.html

2021-05-28T17:13:05.000Z,AMC & r/wallstreetbets: A Market Moving Combo,"'Meme stocks' are back in fashion, and AMC AMC is stealing the spotlight with a nearly 200% rally in the past 5 days of trading, and it only seems to be accelerating with another 20% push today alone. Reddit's r/wallstreetbets (WSB) message board and its 10.2 million (self-proclaimed) 'degenerates' are back in the markets with a vengeance catalyzed by a renewed sense of optimism about GameStop GME. This triggered buying in all this cohort's favorite stocks. The only source that I can identify as the catalyst for the reinvigorated love for meme stocks like AMC, Express EXPR, and Koss KOSS was GameStop's plan to build out an NFT platform on the Ethereum blockchain. This announcement triggered WSB's 10.2 million retail traders to start buying short-duration calls in their favorite 'short-squeezed' stocks like there is no tomorrow. WSB seems to be targeting AMC over GME because these shares were trading below $20 (until today, of course) compared to the roughly $240 price tag on one GameStop share. Small retail traders on WSB can afford the cheaper call options on AMC shares as opposed to any GME option. The price was right for AMC shares, and combining that with the overzealous sense of optimism about movie theaters' performance in the new normal caused a domino effect that is driving AMC to the moon. Most of this week's AMC traders are operating under the assumption that they are causing another short-squeeze, but this is not what's triggering the prolific stock rally, as most of the shorts have already gotten out. What's happening with AMC shares is linked to the short-duration call options that are being purchased in masses. Yesterday, millions of AMC call contracts expiring today traded hands, which had the leveraged impact on the share price we saw. When one purchases a call option, they are typically buying it from a market maker who will, in turn, purchase the delta equivalent in shares (i.e., if the delta were 0.41, the market maker would buy 41 shares on each contract they sell). The market maker would then adjust the number of 'hedging shares' it needs as the delta goes up or down. Delta's go up with the underlying stock price, and in a situation where calls are expiring soon, delta moves much quicker (aka gamma: the speed at which delta moves).

2021-05-28T15:40:20.000Z,Why AMC Entertainment Stock Rallied Again,"AMC Video 28.05.21. Shares of the theater operator AMC Entertainment gained additional upside momentum and moved to new highs as the rally in “meme stocks” continued. Beyond Meat stock gained some ground today, while GameStop shares opened higher but moved below yesterday’s close as traders decided to take some profits off the table. It looks that there are still many short positions in AMC Entertainment, and retail traders managed to orchestate a major short squeeze. The stock traded near the $2.00 level at the beginning of this year and has recently managed to touch highs at $36.72, so such a move may continue to attract short sellers that are willing to bet that retail traders’ activity will cool down and the stock will move back to more reasonable levels. Analysts expect that AMC Entertainment will report a loss of $3.29 per share in 2021 and $0.85 per share in 2022. While the reopening of the economy will surely provide support to the company’s business, AMC Entertainment is nowhere near profitability in the near term. There is no fundamental reason for the meteoric rise of the company’s stock, but fundamentals will not matter as long as AMC Entertainment stays popular on WallStreetBets and other social media forums. I’d note that there is a big difference with the recent rally in GameStop shares as AMC Entertainment stock is moving higher on solid trading volume which resembles the volume that was seen back when the stock enjoyed strong rally in late January. In GameStop case, the trading volume is well below the levels that were seen in January – March of this year. The high trading volume indicates that there is a lot of speculative interest in the stock, and AMC Entertainment shares will remain highly volatile in the upcoming trading sessions. Traders should be prepared for very fast moves and keep in mind that the company’s current valuation is completely detached from fundamentals.

2021-05-28T13:36:17.000Z,AMC pops as Reddit traders double down,"Yahoo Finance’s Julie Hyman, Myles Udland, and Brian Sozzi discuss the latest action in the Reddit-fueled meme stocks craze, and break down why the rally isn’t going away anytime soon. MYLES UDLAND: All right, let's take a look now at the meme trade because as we mentioned, I mean, it is full on back in this market. AMC is now the star of the show, taking over from GameStop. But let us not sleep on GameStop, which has had a huge week. AMC shares, as we noted in the premarket, up about 15%. And Julie, we see the heat map here of some of these meme names. But I am just shocked to see AMC up about 35% over the last week, up 17% in premarket trade. And we talked to Rich Greenfield a week ago. And he was sort of, like, telling us, reminding us that this is still a very much a passionate Reddit trade. And I think I had certainly fallen asleep on it. And here we are, with gains now looking-- stocks basically doubled in just a couple of weeks. JULIE HYMAN: Yeah, and you know how he reminded us, he said that AMC is not a good business and still is in secular decline. I wrote up that story and got quite a lot of Twitter hate from folks who are still short squeezing that stock. So that was a little bit of a wake up call for me personally to know that people on Reddit were still paying attention to the likes of an AMC. Pretty incredible, isn't it? I'm actually going to switch on over since we're looking at AMC because I am curious to look at that sort of longer term chart. There's a two-year chart of AMC. I mean, look at that thing. It's just kind of amazing. The thing was obviously left for dead, right? And then we saw the initial spike, the spike now, obviously, larger even than that. We got some interesting numbers, by the way, from Bespoke Investment Group that also talks about sort of the magnitude of the activity around AMC. They report-- they said that yesterday, AMC stock alone made up nearly 2/3 of the New York Stock Exchange consolidated turnover. And they said the NYSE is only one trading venue, but still, even as a sample, it was consisting of so much of that trading volume and turnover, $16 billion traded. It's just kind of staggering to think about, guys.                 ",https://finance.yahoo.com/video/amc-pops-reddit-traders-double-133617963.html

2021-05-28T12:28:07.000Z,AMC shares retreat but end week up 116% after 4-day rally,"By Aaron Saldanha and Sinéad Carew (Reuters) -Shares of movie theater chain AMC Entertainment closed lower on Friday, snapping a four-day rally that saw them gain 116% on the week. After vaulting to a record high during the session, AMC's shares finished down 1.5% at $26.12. The stock's weekly gain was its largest since January. Shares in GameStop, meanwhile, closed down 12.6% on Friday at $222 after hitting a session peak of $268.79. For the week, GameStop shares registered a gain of 25%, their biggest weekly advance since mid-March. The video game retailer has been at the heart of the so-called ""stonks"" retail-trading mania this year. ""This is confirmation we're seeing retail investors coming back into the equity market after being sidelined,"" said Viraj Patel, global macro strategist for Vanda Research. ""It feels like a deja-vu of what happened in January,"" Investors betting against AMC and Gamestop had a rough week with AMC short-sellers suffering $1.2 billion in mark-to-market losses for the week while GameStop shorts were down $518.6 million, according to the latest data from S3 Partners. Retail traders' shift into so-called meme stocks - shares favored by the denizens of online communities such as Reddit's WallStreetBets - comes on the back of a selloff in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies whose prices have slumped in recent weeks. Bitcoin, the world's biggest cryptocurrency, was up about 1% for the week. AMC saw some $127 million in net inflows from retail investors on Thursday, its biggest single-day net inflows since Jan. 27, according to data from Vanda Research. AMC rose 35.5% on Thursday, adding more than $3.3 billion to its market value, according to data from Refinitiv. With 656 million shares changing hands on Friday, AMC was the most traded stock on U.S. exchanges for the second day in a row. Data also showed the cinema operator was the most traded stock on brokerage Robinhood's popular trading app, as well as on that of UK-based Freetrade, where buy orders have outnumbered sell orders two-to-one.

2021-05-28T09:00:00.000Z,You have to be a professional investor ‘to do well’: Bruce Greenwald,"Columbia Business School Professor Bruce Greenwald joins 'Influencers with Andy Serwer' to discuss the stock market and modern investing. - But why? If markets are efficient, then why does Buffet say that you should invest in an index fund? - Oh OK, and I think that's a good point. To do well, to be on the right side of the train, you have to be a professional investor. So I'll say something that ironically should absolutely dominate the investment world and doesn't, which is, if I'm going to be on the right side of the transaction more often than not, I probably ought to be a specialist. So you don't have internal medicine guys doing orthopedic surgery. Medicine law is highly specialized. And if I've spent my whole life trading on shore South Texas, Gulf Coast oil leases, and that's all I do. And you fly in from Germany and buy an oil lease from me. Who do you think made money in that transaction? - Right. - And the idea of specialization plays no role in academic finance. Adam Smith, notwithstanding. - But does this suggest that for ordinary investors, then they should pretty much stick to index funds maybe, unless you're in a field? Like say, you're a dentist, and you see that this new product is going gangbusters. And people don't seem to realize it, and then you buy that stock. - That is a very good way to put it. The problem, of course, with that is, once the dentist does that in dentistry, he decides he's a market genius, and he decides he can do it at every price. Now, you have to be incredibly disciplined about why you're the person who's going to be on the right side of the trade. And most part time investors are not equipped to do that. But if you just buy the index, you can't be on the wrong side of the trade. - Right, right. - And it prevents you from overinvesting in the glamour stocks, and that's the sense in which Buffet is absolutely right.",https://finance.yahoo.com/video/professional-investor-well-bruce-greenwald-090000055.html

2021-05-27T19:15:00.000Z,Is There A Huge Undisclosed Short In Oil Explorer Reconnaissance Energy Africa?,"One of our picks for the most exiting oil plays of the last decade, Reconnaissance Energy Africa (TSX.V: RECO, OTCMKTS:RECAF) appears it may have come under heavy short selling as revealed in a recent report by Buyins.net. http://www.buyins.com/reports/recaf5-25-21.pdf Since late November 2020, 85,918,776 total shares of the company have been sold short in the U.S., according to the Buyins.net report. That means an average of 57.16% of the company’s shares traded every day in the U.S. look like they have been sold short. In Canada, the numbers seem even larger. The report shows that a shocking 113,188,174 shares of the company have been sold short since May 24, 2016 (inferred from US short selling average in RECAF). That number tells an even more surprising story in combination with the charts below that we think expose the truth: the majority of this short position may have started in the middle of 2020. And with ReconAfrica expected to announce results from Well 2 within the next 4 weeks and if those results are good, which the company’s management seems very confident about, then Short sellers may not have a long time to get out of their huge position. We think these charts tell the real story and the current state of play, but it’s important investors understand the following: There are 4 trade identifiers – buying, selling, shorting and covering. The numbers above, however, report that 57.16% of trading in the company’s shares is short selling. As a result, that would mean that only 42.67% is divided amongst the other 3 trade identifiers. If you divide this by 3, it appears only 16% is covering every day. Only 16% is buying, and only 16% is selling. If only 16% is covering every day, then there is 3.5 times more short-selling than covering. We called Tom Ronk of Buyins.net after the report came out to dig deeper into the numbers. He told us this could be one of the larger short positions (as a % of total volume) he has come across in his experience recently. He believes the total undisclosed short position in ReconAfrica’s shares across Canada and the U.S. could be in the tens of millions of shares.

2021-05-27T17:54:26.000Z,Wall Street Bets: Redditors Scoop Up More AMC as Buy List Grows,"Retail investors led by Reddit forum WallStreetBets continue to drive up the price of movie chain AMC Entertainment, with the stock tacking on another 19% today. Investors are so committed to the company that they are talking about going back to the movies and splurging for popcorn when AMC shares hit USD 30. They just might get their wish. Investors are comparing AMC to “sitting at a slot machine in Vegas,” and by the looks of it they are not too far off. They are continuing to buy even as the price continues to rise while setting their sights on lambos and holding on for dear life. It is a perfect storm of sorts where hedge funds are buying AMC shares to cover their short positions and institutional investors are reporting jumping on the bandwagon to ride the wave. Meanwhile, short seller losses are mounting, reaching USD 1.8 billion in recent days across GameStop, AMC and Virgin Galactic, according to CNBC. So far this year, USD 6.7 billion has been wiped away from short-sellers in GameStop. While AMC and GameStop are two of the most popular stocks on the radar of WallStreetBets, they are not the only short game in town. Another post on the WallStreetBets forum is shining the spotlight on UWM Holdings, the parent company of United Wholesale Mortgage. The stock is up nearly 4% today and according to the Redditors there are some catalysts floating around. Short interest in UWMC is said to be 22%, which incidentally is higher than that of AMC and Gamestop, at 21% and 17%, respectively. In addition, the company announced in its Q1 earnings report that it is repurchasing as much as USD 300 million in shares in the next two years, starting this month. Today the stock was in the pipeline to be added to the MSCI Global Small Cap Index. With a market cap of USD 14 billion, Wall Street Bets suggested that it could make its way to the index’s top 10 rankings. Meanwhile, the meme stocks are also on the radar of Bank of America analysts, who believe the Reddit trend could be here to stay thanks to the rise of zero-commission trading platforms, more idle time and higher balances in savings accounts.

2021-05-27T15:35:54.000Z,Why GameStop Stock Rallied In Recent Days,"GameStop Video 27.05.21. Shares of GameStop gained strong upside momentum after the company became popular again on Reddit’s WallStreetBets. Shares of other “meme stock”, AMC Entertainment Holdings, also enjoyed a strong rally. It also looks that Beyond Meat has become the next target of the social media crowd as its shares have moved from the $100 level to $140 in less than two weeks while trending on Reddit. GameStop also benefited from rumors about the company’s potential move into the non-fungible token (NFT) market, although it is not clear whether GameStop stock needs any catalysts other than increased popularity in social media. It should be noted that the volume of trading in GameStop shares dropped in recent months but the stock failed to develop sustainable downside momentum despite its rich valuation which signaled that retail traders did not rush to exit their positions. Analysts expect that GameStop will report a loss of $0.9 per share this year and a loss of $0.53 in the next year, but the market ignores valuation concerns. It looks that professional investors and traders have underestimated the ability of retail traders to hold their positions despite huge volatility. The possible explanation for this phenomenon is that speculative positions of retail traders are often modest in size which makes it easier to stomach huge volatility. While GameStop is trading at more than 3 price-to-sales which is an absurd valuation for a retailer, the market will continue to ignore valuation concerns as everyone is focused on the stock’s popularity in social media. In this light, speculative traders should pay attention to Reddit and Twitter trends rather than the company’s financials which will have little or no impact on the near-term trading of the stock. Once GameStop shares get out of fashion in social media, they will likely develop downside momentum. For a look at all of today’s economic events, check out our economic calendar.

If you want to skip our detailed analysis of these companies, go directly to the 5 Best Small-Cap Stocks to Buy According to Billionaire Mario Gabelli. Investors are confident in the economy's gradual recovery after suffering heavy losses amid the coronavirus crisis. As confidence for the post-pandemic economy builds, small-cap stocks are gaining traction. Small-cap and cyclical equities are more sensitive to the economy, so a robust economic rebound would favor them. According to Forbes, in recent months, the small-cap Russell 2000 Index has outperformed previously untouchable large-cap indices such as the Nasdaq 100. For the six months ended February 28, 2021, the Russell was up more than 40%, while the Nasdaq 100 was up only 7% and the S&P 500 was up around 10%. Small-cap stocks are popular among investors because of their potential for providing better returns in the long term. Small-cap stocks will continue to thrive given their ability to sustain profits during an economic recession. In the first quarter of 2021, The Russell 2000 and S&P 600, two popular small-cap indexes, returned 12.4% and 17.9%, respectively. A perfect example of a small-cap stock that grew big in the clinical-stage psychedelic medicine biotech sector is Mind Medicine (MindMed) Inc. (NASDAQ:MNMD), which is one of the most popular stocks among Reddit and Robinhood investors. Mind Medicine (MindMed) Inc. (NASDAQ:MNMD) manufactures and markets medicines and treatments inspired by psychedelics to treat addiction and mental disease. The company has a market cap of $864 million and a 52-week price range of $0.3950-$5.9900. Shares of Mind Medicine (MindMed) Inc. (NASDAQ:MNMD) jumped 677% over the last twelve months. Another notable stock that was once cheap and trading at an affordable price is GameStop Corp. (NYSE:GME). In 2002, the company started with a lower market cap of around $1.12 billion. As of May 27, the market cap of GameStop Corp. (NYSE:GME) is already at $17 billion. The American video gaming merchandise retailer provides the most comprehensive range of new and used video gaming consoles, accessories, and video game titles in both physical and digital forms.

2021-05-27T11:53:45.000Z,GameStop’s “Completely Disconnected” Share Price Tough to Understand,"The massive short squeeze in late January briefly propelled the stock to absurd highs, and saw the price correcting sharply soon thereafter. However, for seemingly lesser reasons, GameStop Corp.'s (GME) share price has continued to intermittently spike and climb as retail investors pile in, hoping for another fundamental-shattering rise. (See GME Stock Analysis on TipRanks)   Michael Pachter of Wedbush Securities published an April 27th report detailing his less optimistic perspective on the phenomenon, rating GameStop a Sell, and assigning a price target of $39. At the time of his writing, GameStop was at $180.25 per share, although about a month later, on Wednesday May 26th, the stock closed at $240.50 after a blistering gain of +34.53% from two days of trading. Pachter’s 12-month price target represents an 83.92% downside potential.   On TipRanks, Pachter is a four-star analyst, ranked as #1,119 out of 7,524 on the website. GameStop has an average analyst rating consensus of Moderate Sell, based on 2 Hold and 4 Sell ratings. The stock’s average analyst price target is currently $55.80.   Michael Pachter delineated several reasons why the company and its situation have been improving, including the launching of new gaming consoles, the completion of an at-the-market equity offering, and major executive changes.  Pachter further explained that by issuing 3.5 million shares of stock, GameStop successfully raised $551 million. Using these funds, the company wishes to shift to a more digital-retail presence, as well as to strengthen its balance sheet.   GameStop had been hit hard by forced retail store closures during the COVID-19 pandemic. In order to “de-densify the store footprint,” the outgoing CEO had successfully closed 693 retail storefronts during 2020 alone. This move reduced nearly $400 million in expenses year-over-year.  Due to the positive changes explained above, Pachter raised his price target from $29 to $39, which still remains overwhelmingly bearish from the current stock price.   Michael Pachter admitted that GameStop’s volatile price fluctuations will provide for some investors to “profit handsomely,” but was firm in his analysis that the share price is “completely disconnected from business fundamentals.”    Disclaimer: The opinions expressed in this article are solely those of the featured analyst.

2021-05-27T10:20:10.000Z,Should Vanguard S&P SmallCap 600 Growth ETF (VIOG) Be on Your Investing Radar?,"Looking for broad exposure to the Small Cap Growth segment of the US equity market? You should consider the Vanguard S&P SmallCap 600 Growth ETF (VIOG), a passively managed exchange traded fund launched on 09/09/2010. The fund is sponsored by Vanguard. It has amassed assets over $554.05 million, making it one of the average sized ETFs attempting to match the Small Cap Growth segment of the US equity market. Why Small Cap Growth With more potential comes more risk, and small cap companies, with market capitalization below $2 billion, epitomizes this way of thinking. While growth stocks do boast higher than average sales and earnings growth rates, and they are expected to grow faster than the wider market, investors should note these kinds of stocks have higher valuations. Further, growth stocks have a higher level of volatility associated with them. Compared to value stocks, growth stocks are a safer bet in a strong bull market, but don't perform as strongly in almost all other financial environments. Costs When considering an ETF's total return, expense ratios are an important factor, and cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive counterparts in the long term if all other factors remain equal. Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.15%, making it one of the least expensive products in the space. It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 0.54%. Sector Exposure and Top Holdings It is important to delve into an ETF's holdings before investing despite the many upsides to these kinds of funds like diversified exposure, which minimizes single stock risk. And, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis. This ETF has heaviest allocation to the Information Technology sector--about 18.10% of the portfolio.

The company on Thursday reported a record number of new customer sign-ups at the start of this year, as assets under management, revenues, and profits all soared. AJ Bell said it signed up 51,492 new customers in the six months to the end of March 2021. That was a record total for a half-year and up 32% on the same period a year ago. The boom in new sign-ups led to record inflows of £3.1bn and record levels of trading.  Read more: Amateur investors chase profits during the pandemic The surge in sign-ups coincided with heightened interest in the stock market at the start of this year. Amateur investors caught the world's attention in January when a group of traders from the Reddit forum r/WallStreetBets waged war against hedge funds targeting stocks like GameStop (GME) and AMC (AMC). The battle attracted global attention, with platforms like Freetrade in the UK reporting huge interest among UK investors. AJ Bell's 41,584 new sign-ups in the period were for its direct to consumer offering. The company reported ""increased demand for dealing in US equities"" and increased dealing activity, which helped transaction fee revenues almost double. ""We continue to see an increase in applications from younger and less experienced investors, as a growing number of people look to take control of their financial future,"" the company said. Read more: The GameStop short squeeze was 'the grand awakening': expert Andy Bell, chief executive officer at AJ Bell, didn't specifically name GameStop or Reddit and instead said low interest rates caused by COVID were behind the boom. ""The average age of our new direct-to-consumer customers was 38 in the first half of the year, five years younger than the average of the wider customer base,"" he said. ""Our record number of new customers has been helped by the low interest rate environment, as savers seek higher returns on cash held in savings accounts and Cash ISAs.""

GameStop and AMC, two wildly popular meme stocks among members of Reddit’s WallStreetBets forum, soared more than 16% and 19% respectively as speculative assets picked up steam. Those gains pushed mark-to-market losses for short-sellers to roughly $8.1 billion for the year, according to S3 Partners data. The video-game retailer and movie-theater chain have recaptured Wall Street’s attention as analysts speculate retail traders in particular are driving the action. The hashtag #AMC500k continued to trend on Twitter, while mentions on social trading platforms like StockTwits surged. GameStop short-sellers were dealt mark-to-market losses of nearly $383 million on Wednesday, Ihor Dusaniwsky, S3 Partners’ managing director of predictive analytics, said by email, pushing year-to-date losses to $6.7 billion. For AMC shorts, the day’s loss came in at $291 million, meaning short-sellers are down more than $1.3 billion this year. Bearish bets have remained steady with roughly one-fifth of available GameStop and AMC shares currently sold short, according to data compiled by S3 Partners.

2021-05-26T20:37:08.000Z,GameStop (GME) Can't Stop Won't Stop,"GameStop GME shares have ripped over 30% higher in the past two trading sessions. GME has soared back towards the $250 range following news that the enterprise is building out a non-fungible token (NFT) platform on Ethereum’s blockchain. There have been rumors that GameStop would be dipping its toes into cryptocurrencies & NFTs. GameStop’s new NFT webpage confirmed speculation about their ventures into digital assets, which has retail traders on WSB going gangbusters. This announcement didn’t just spur a rally in GME shares but has AMC AMC soaring as well. WSB traders have turned AMC and GME into gambling tools. You can see this gambling mentality with the outsized price action in AMC on news that had nothing to with the company. Ryan Cohen, co-founder of the e-commerce giant Chewy turned activist investor, has been the knight in shining armor that GameStop needed. Still, GameStop is worth nowhere near to its present $16.8B valuation in its current state. +1,500% Growth: One of 2021’s Most Exciting Investment Opportunities

2021-05-26T20:31:09.000Z,"Meme Stocks, SPACs Rebound: ‘Reddit Raiders Are at It Again’","(Bloomberg) -- Investors are rediscovering their appetite for the market’s speculative fringes. The shares of GameStop Corp. and AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. -- the poster-children of this year’s Reddit boom -- are surging. Interest in special purpose acquisition companies has reignited with Chamath Palihapitiya’s blank-check firms leading the way. And Bitcoin and Ether are up after last week’s bonfire in cryptocurrencies. While the catalyst is unclear, retail traders appear to be driving the action. Touts are plastered all over social media with individual investors attempting to pump their bets on Twitter, Reddit’s WallStreetBets and chatrooms on Stocktwits. “The Reddit raiders are at it again,” Michael Pachter, an analyst at Wedbush Securities, said as shares of GameStop and AMC were among the most actively traded stocks Wednesday. “It looks retail driven to me.” Memes Are Forever While the S&P 500 is virtually flat this month, shares of Reddit favorites GameStop and AMC are soaring. Including Wednesday’s gains, GameStop is up 40% in May while AMC has surged 95% over the same period. The pair of stocks have been among the best performers in a basket of 37 so-called meme stocks tracked by Bloomberg in the month of May. As a group, Wednesday’s 7.7% rally marked its best session since the retail mania gripped the market back in March. The gains are sure to bring more pain for short sellers betting against GameStop and AMC with the group down roughly $8.1 billion in mark-to-market losses this year, according to S3 Partners. With the retail investor movement regaining back momentum and both stocks having high short interest, there’s potential for a short squeeze, S3 Partners’ managing director of predictive analytics Ihor Dusaniwsky said by email. “Short sellers may start trimming their positions in the face of continued stock price strength,” he said. They had seen mark-to-market losses of about $475 million for the month of May alone prior to the latest spike, S3 Partners data show.

If you want to skip our detailed analysis of these companies, go directly to the 5 Popular Stocks Reddit's WallStreetBets is Talking About Today. The meme stock rallies that shook the market at the turn of the year and led to regulatory probes in the United States appear to have returned to haunt financial experts in the past few days. If previous trends are anything to go by, the finance world should expect retail investors, who use internet platforms like Reddit and Twitter, as well as trading applications like Robinhood, to group themselves and collectively bet against big finance positions on certain stocks in the coming days.  One of the most popular places where these retail investors exchange ideas is the Reddit community named WallStreetBets. The forum has more than 10 million members who share thousands of posts about the market each day. Earlier this week, the share price of GameStop Corp. (NYSE: GME), the video game retailer at the center of the meme stock rally a few months ago, jumped more than 13% as Reddit speculation rose that GameStop Corp. (NYSE: GME) would be entering the non-fungible token market.  Another popular stock on the internet platform is MicroVision, Inc. (NASDAQ: MVIS), the technology company most famous for marketing lidar sensors used in autonomous vehicles. In late April, MicroVision, Inc. (NASDAQ: MVIS) stock jumped more than 26% as WallStreetBets members highlighted the company in their forums in a short squeeze push. These retail investors usually favor companies with high short interest. About 20% of the shares of MicroVision, Inc. (NASDAQ: MVIS) were held short last month.  In the past few days, the Redditors have also been interested in BlackBerry Limited (NYSE: BB), the Canadian software company that provides encryption and security services. BlackBerry Limited (NYSE: BB) is one of the most undervalued technology stocks on the market considering the upside potential it has as a leader in cybersecurity innovation. On May 17, BlackBerry Limited (NYSE: BB) announced new prevention-first and artificial intelligence-driven products related to endpoint and network security capabilities.

2021-05-26T19:08:12.000Z,New FOMO ETF debuts on the market,"Matthew Tuttle, Tuttle Capital Management CEO, joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss the new FOMO ETF and outlook on meme stocks. KRISTIN MYERS: All right, let's pivot now. It's time for our ETF report brought to you by Invesco QQQ. We're joined now by Matthew Tuttle, Tuttle Capital Management CEO. Matthew, I want to start here with the value and growth narrative that we've been seeing lately. We see a lot of conversations around that positioning. How are you guys thinking about it, especially as some folks are thinking about the ETFs? Is it more in value? Or are some folks still going after those big growth names? MATTHEW TUTTLE: So I mean they're going after both. And it's a constant battle, day in, day out. You've got some days that are growth days, some days that are value days. You've got the majority of Wall Street now saying, hey, it's value. And, you know, and what we try to do is we'll just go where the trends tell us. And right now, we're positioned more in value than anything else. We certainly don't want to ignore growth. So I mean, we're not trying to time anything and saying, hey, we're going to be 100% in value because that's a recipe for disaster. And no one can time that stuff. But certainly, right now, we've got a tilt towards those value names because that's just been where money is going lately. ALEXIS CHRISTOFOROUS: And I want to draw some attention to a brand new ETF that you have. And by brand new, I mean, I think it launched yesterday. And I love the ticker symbol. It's FOMO, for Fear Of Missing Out. Tell us about the stocks that are part of this ETF, and why did you feel the need to do this? MATTHEW TUTTLE: So we felt the need to do it because thematic investing has gotten real popular lately. And we just don't like the way that it's being done. So what you end up with is you end up with these narrow-based indexes that are built based off of what happened in the past, not necessarily what's going to happen going forward. They don't rebalance frequently. So they get out of sync with what's going on. And they tend to be-- have some real heavy weightings in certain areas or certain stocks.

Jared Blikre is here with a closer look at some of the stocks with-- making some big moves today. And you have got your eye on the meme stocks and some cryptocurrencies, which seem to be bouncing back, Jared. JARED BLIKRE: Yeah, I'll tell you what. Let's start with the meme stocks. And I got a heat map up there on the YFi Interactive. I haven't seen this much green in this proportion or these proportions in several months. You'd have to go back to March. And what stands out is a lot of these are the old GameStop related names that were first kind of pumped in this to the moon endeavor right here. And we can see in GameStop, it's basically been consolidating for several months. And that gives it the power to boost to really accelerate out of this downtrend here. So this is a very bold technical setup for GameStop. AMC is looking even better. You can see it's taken out these highs right here for March. And it's closing in on these highs from February, late January, which was the original GameStop period. So, pretty incredible action there in some of these names. You know, the back story on AMC, they've been raising capital. It's a reopening story. Go back to GameStop, there was some news yesterday centered around a job posting on their site. If you go to nft.gamestop.com, you can see they're looking for Ethereum developers. So the stock is still kind of a black box on a fundamental perspective. We don't really know what they're going to do just yet, but really interesting to see investors taking a hold of this new information. And we've got to check out crypto, too. And here we go. We can see Bitcoin is up 2%, Ether, 5%. Let's see, what's Dogecoin doing? Not seeing it right here, but Ripple's up 5 as well. So it's been a pretty good day for a lot of the FOMO instruments that we saw pick up so much steam earlier in the year.

2021-05-26T17:25:06.000Z,"‘Meme Stocks’ Extend Grip on Wall Street as GME, AMC Take Off","They’ve earned the name as ‘meme stocks’ given their ability to trade on social media sentiment rather than the bottom line. And while there might be something whimsical about them, the two most popular meme stocks — GameStop and AMC Entertainment — are generating some serious returns of late. In addition, even though it doesn’t belong in the same asset class, bitcoin is also getting lumped into the meme category by some analysts for its non-conventional features. GameStop and AMC are each advancing by double-digit percentages today, up 16.5% and 18.7%, respectively. Today’s gains bring the tallies for the week to 36% for Gamestop and 43% for AMC shares. Gamestop shares are up more than 1,200 % year-to-date, while AMC’s stock has risen over 800%. Could there be more room to run? Retail investors are betting on it. Over in crypto land, the bitcoin price is continuing on its path to recovery after last week’s 40%-plus decline where it managed to hold above the USD 30K threshold. BTC is on the brink of crossing the psychologically important USD 40K level once again. Sanctuary Wealth portfolio manager and CIO Jeff Kilburg is quoted by CNBC as saying that the rebound in the meme stocks is being fueled by “oversold conditions” in these names as they fell in sympathy with bitcoin’s recent drop, as well as some good old fashioned profit taking. Meanwhile, the WallStreetBets forum on Reddit has been spearheading the buying in the stock market’s most shorted stocks since the beginning of the year. Reddit members’ attention, however, is reportedly starting to shift from equities to cryptocurrencies, based on anecdotal evidence tied to comment volumes. The Financial Times reported that Quiver Quantitative, a research firm, found that the number of comments on the r/Cryptocurrency subreddit increased 82% in the first three weeks of May vs. a 42% decline on the WallStreetBets forum. That trend might have had something to do with the Elon Musk effect on bitcoin.          ",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/meme-stocks-extend-grip-wall-172506656.html

GameStop shares surged 15.8% to $242.56, around its highest level since mid-March, while AMC shares shot up 19.2% to $19.56, the highest since Jan. 27. CFRA on Wednesday raised its price target for AMC shares to $18 from $2.50. Shares of GameStop and other companies popular on forums such as Reddit's WallStreetBets have been climbing in recent weeks and the rally accelerated on Tuesday. GameStop is now 70% above its closing low for May, while AMC has risen 95% in the month-to-date. GameStop's big gains have caused some bearish investors to retreat, forced to buy shares to cover their short-sale loans, said Ihor Dusaniwsky, managing director of predictive analytics at S3. ""We have started to see some short covering in GME as mark-to-market losses mount on the short side,"" Dusaniwsky said in an email on Wednesday. Around 958,000 shares of GameStop, worth $201 million, were bought to cover short sales over the last week, S3 data showed. Roughly 11.55 million shares of GameStop, or 20.3% of its float, are currently sold short, Dusaniwsky said. Short-sellers in GameStop are down $6.7 billion in year-to-date mark-to-market losses, including $339 million from Tuesday's more than 16% gain and about $383 million due to Wednesday's move, S3 data showed. A short squeeze helped send GameStop shares increase by more than 1,600% in January to a record high of $483. The stock pared most of those gains in the following month, only to bounce again in March. Some analysts also pointed to speculation that GameStop may be building a nonfungible token (NFT) platform.

2021-05-25T20:54:54.000Z,GameStop jumps more than 16% as 'meme' stocks roar higher,"By Sinéad Carew (Reuters) - Shares of GameStop soared 16.3% on Tuesday after hitting their highest level since late March, and other so-called ""meme"" stocks also rallied as investors shifted back into the retail favorites that had notched big gains earlier in the year. The video game retailer’s shares finished at $209.43, marking their first close above $200 since March 19. Shares of AMC Entertainment Holdings ended up about 20% while Koss Corp gained 22.9%. ""Once it goes over $200 the buzz starts,"" said Dennis Dick, head of markets structure and proprietary trader at Bright Trading LLC. You can “100% peg it to social media."" GameStop’s shares and those of other stocks popular on forums such as Reddit’s WallStreetBets have climbed in recent weeks, a move that has come amid a broad sell-off in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, another investment popular among individual investors. GameStop closed 46.5% above its lowest close so far for May, while Bitcoin is down about 35% so far this month and rival cryptocurrency ether is about 42% below its record, reached on May 12 in a sell-off that has come amid increasing scrutiny from regulators in the United States and China. Denizens of WallStreetBets and some Twitter users also speculated that the recent moves in GameStop and AMC may be forcing bearish investors to unwind their bets, an event known as a short squeeze. Roughly 26% of GameStop's float or 14.76 million shares were on loan as of May 24, according to Astec Analytics. More than 14 million shares in the company changed hands on Tuesday, marking its busiest trading day since mid-April. Some 129 million shares of AMC Entertainment, or 28.8% of its float, were on loan on May 24, Astec data showed. A short squeeze helped send shares of GameStop on a 1600% run in January, though the stock pared much of those gains the following month. Users on Twitter, meanwhile, exhorted one another to hold or buy more shares of AMC, many under the hashtag #notapenny, which notched more than 17,000 posts by 4pm ET.

2021-05-25T20:13:32.000Z,GameStop Soars as WallStreetBets Favorites Stage Late Rally,"(Bloomberg) -- GameStop Corp. helped lead a bevy of retail trader favorites higher on Tuesday as investors touted the stocks on social media platforms including Twitter, Stocktwits and trader chatroom WallStreetBets. GameStop soared 16% to $209.43, the highest since March 17, propelled by an influx in mid-afternoon trading in New York. Movie theater company AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. also stood out, with the stock jumping 20% to a roughly four-month high. A basket of 37 so-called meme stocks tracked by Bloomberg spiked 5.4% to break above its 50-day moving average for the first time since March. The rally came as trading volumes jumped for AMC and Gamestop, as well as for companies including headphone maker Koss Corp. and clothing company Naked Brand Group Ltd. More than 200 million shares of AMC changed hands Tuesday, making it the second most actively traded stock with a value greater than $1. For GameStop, more than 14 million shares were traded -- more than triple what’s been typical over the past five sessions. When the dust settled on Tuesday’s session, Koss was the group’s top performer, staging a 23% rally to $20.78 while Naked Brand rose 7%. Other retail favorites like Express Inc. and Sundial Growers Inc. climbed more than 5%. The rally marks a fourth day of gains for the group and another notable departure from the broader market’s performance. Most major groups in the S&P 500 fell after a gauge of new U.S. home sales slid by more than forecast as higher prices restrained demand. The index dropped 0.2%.

2021-05-25T12:30:12.000Z,Here's How Much You'd Have If You Invested $1000 in GameStop a Decade Ago,"How much a stock's price changes over time is important for most investors, since price performance can both impact your investment portfolio and help you compare investment results across sectors and industries. FOMO, or the fear of missing out, also plays a role in investing, particularly with tech giants and popular consumer-facing stocks. What if you'd invested in GameStop (GME) ten years ago? It may not have been easy to hold on to GME for all that time, but if you did, how much would your investment be worth today?

2021-05-24T21:45:09.000Z,GameStop (GME) Outpaces Stock Market Gains: What You Should Know,"GameStop (GME) closed the most recent trading day at $180.01, moving +1.82% from the previous trading session. This move outpaced the S&P 500's daily gain of 0.99%. Prior to today's trading, shares of the video game retailer had gained 16.94% over the past month. This has outpaced the Retail-Wholesale sector's loss of 3.17% and the S&P 500's loss of 0.26% in that time. Investors will be hoping for strength from GME as it approaches its next earnings release. The company is expected to report EPS of -$0.56, up 65.22% from the prior-year quarter. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $1.17 billion, up 14.63% from the year-ago period. GME's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of -$0.63 per share and revenue of $5.63 billion. These results would represent year-over-year changes of +70.56% and +10.69%, respectively. Investors might also notice recent changes to analyst estimates for GME. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability. Our research shows that these estimate changes are directly correlated with near-term stock prices. To benefit from this, we have developed the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system. The Zacks Rank system, which ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 13.15% higher. GME is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). The Retail - Consumer Electronics industry is part of the Retail-Wholesale sector. This group has a Zacks Industry Rank of 124, putting it in the top 49% of all 250+ industries.

You can skip our detailed analysis of these companies and go directly to 5 Best Undervalued Stocks to Buy Now According to Reddit. The stock market has been on a wild ride since the start of the year with stock volatility, influx of retail investors that strategize on social media, and stimulus packages designed to jumpstart the economy all factoring into major market highs and lows so far. Investors on internet platform Reddit have been by far the most influential in shaping market dynamics through this uncertain period. At the turn of the year, these young investors drove a record 140% rally in the stock of video game retailer GameStop Corp. (NYSE: GME). The GameStop Corp. (NYSE: GME) saga led to a regulatory probe in the United States and caught several well established financial institutions off-guard. Months after the historic rally, it would be fair to say that this new dynamic in global market trading has proved more resilient than initially thought. Young investors now routinely spoil hedge fund bets by banding together through Reddit groups and use collective action to spur stock rallies and crashes. These groups are public and the conversations on them make for interesting reading. For example, Reddit users have been sharing their thoughts on undervalued stocks in recent days. One of the top picks in this category seems to be Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE: BABA), the Chinese technology firm. Despite being the largest online retailer in China, perhaps the biggest internet market in the world, Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE: BABA) shares are moderately priced compared to international competitors and have been hit recently by rumors of Chinese government restrictions on the founder of the firm. Another interesting pick on Reddit forums in the undervalued list is steelmaker Cleveland-Cliffs Inc. (NYSE: CLF), one of the largest steel manufacturers in the United States that has a lot to gain from recent government plans to pour hundreds of billions into American infrastructure. Cleveland-Cliffs Inc. (NYSE: CLF) has also seen share price climb in recent weeks on the back of increasing prices because of a Chinese government crackdown on steel producers. There has also been speculation on the removal of favorable tariffs imposed on the industry in 2017.

Today, and without fear of getting squashed like a high-flying bull, it’s time to check out the price charts of three of yesterday’s most-shorted stocks for stronger buying opportunities today. Bitcoin (CCC:BTC-USD)!! Ethereum (CCC:ETH-USD)!! Dogecoin (CCC:DOGE-USD)!! Internet Computer (CCC:ICP-USD)!! These days the Redditors, Robinhood’s band of retail marauders and the nightly news cameras are busy in the crypto market. And right now, I’m guessing that’s much to the chagrin of way too many swing-for-the-fence types who, until recently, may have been considering quitting their day jobs. It’s repetitive to say the least; that is how the market(s) cycle. Right now the crypto scene is remarkably similar to the theme-based trade in the market’s most-shorted stocks earlier this year. And for those that are a bit older and wiser, you could look at pot stocks, dot-coms and other historical precedents. All warn the feeding frenzy in digital coins was destined for a very rude wake-up call. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Sure, go ahead and blame this week’s dazzling correction in cryptos on what you will. Plenty are pointing fingers at China’s mean regulators, Turkey’s unwillingness to play ball or maybe toward one too many DOGE tweets from Tesla’s (NASDAQ:TSLA) Elon Musk. It won’t matter tomorrow and for a few of those 9,000 plus digital assets, today’s excuses will likely turn into long-term value. GameStop (NYSE:GME) Retractable Technologies (NYSEARCA:RVP) Virgin Galactic (NYSE:SPCE) But what will tomorrow or next week bring for this new and exciting secular market? More volatility for certain. But a bottom in cryptos? Those are some big candlesticks to navigate.

2021-05-21T16:20:01.000Z,Should You Consider Investing in GameStop Corp. (GME)?,"Rhizome Partners, an investment management firm, published its first quarter 2021 investor letter – a copy of which can be downloaded here. A return of 11.5% was recorded by the fund, outperforming the S&P 500 Index that delivered a +6.2% return and the FTSE NAREIT All Equity REIT Total Return Index that was up by 8.3% for the same period. You can view the fund’s top 5 holdings to have a peek at their top bets for 2021. Rhizome Partners, in its Q1 2021 investor letter, mentioned GameStop Corp. (NYSE: GME), and shared their insights on the company. GameStop Corp. is a Grapevine, Texas-based electronics retail company that currently has an $11.9 billion market capitalization. Since the beginning of the year, GME delivered an impressive 796.13% return, massively extending its 12-month gains to 3,702.48%. As of May 19, 2021, the stock closed at $168.83 per share. Here is what Rhizome Partners has to say about GameStop Corp. in its Q1 2021 investor letter: ""The first quarter saw some bizarre market reactions. Game Stop is a heavily shorted legacy video game retailer that saw its stock price rise from $17 to a peak of $483 within a month. It appears that retail investors on a Reddit.com forum called WallStreetBets used memes to create a viral feedback loop of forced buying. Game Stop reached $20 billion in market cap and had more daily trading volume than Apple at one point. The Game Stop short squeeze became a black swan event for the short sellers. Large hedge funds such as Melvin Capital suffered 50% losses during a short period and required emergency capital injections that resulted in costly dilution. Shorting is difficult and introduces a risk of ruin. This is especially true in situations where a large percentage of the float is shorted. We want to remind you that we hedge our portfolio via index puts, sector puts, and sometimes buying puts directly in our own portfolio companies. However, we rarely short because 1) we are not good at it 2) the potential for brain damage is too high and 3) we want to avoid the risk of ruin.""

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips If readers need a CliffsNotes lesson on recent events, back in January GameStop was, as a questioning and furrowed brow nightly news alerted us, the saga of an epic short-squeeze. GME stock pitted a mostly pint-size David long the shares versus much larger, professional monied shorts up to their eyeballs in bearish GME stock positions totaling 1.4x the float. There were other short-squeeze and two-for-the-price of one low-priced, heavily shorted stock plays to be sure. AMC (NYSE:AMC). Blackberry (NYSE:BB). Alpine 4 Holdings (NASDAQ:ALPP). Sundial Growers (NASDAQ:SNDL) and many others. And one or two may have made the wallets of this merry band of marauders’ wallets fatter and even slightly sooner than GME shares.

It didn’t last. And just as quickly, GME stock plummeted 92% from a high of $483 to a low of $38.50 over three weeks’ time.

2021-05-21T14:34:37.000Z,Morning Brief: Retail and crypto are dominating the market,"Yahoo Finance breaks down how the data is pointing to meme stocks and cryptocurrency being the main things pushing the market and investors in 2021. BRIAN SOZZI: This was the topic of the Morning Brief newsletter which Myles wrote, and it's fascinating to see what people are searching right now on our site. JULIE HYMAN: Yeah, it really is. You know, so typically, on a given day, we bring you guys trending tickers, right, which is a great tool on our site that shows what Yahoo Finance users are most interested in. So our Jared Blikre, who you guys know well, is our stocks editor, markets editor. He has now compiled the four-week trending tickers, which is really telling. It's not necessarily surprising, but it's still quite interesting. And I guess, drumroll, the top trending ticker over the past four weeks is Dogecoin, which sort of ties back into what you were saying about Elon Musk and tweets, right? And speaking of which, of course, Tesla is on that list as well. But it is interesting how this joke coin, you know-- and it's clearly-- I mean, it's sort of baldly a joke coin-- how it has really entered the consciousness of investors and has really been of such high interest to people, Brian. BRIAN SOZZI: Yeah, and it's also quite interesting, too. Look, these are some of the most volatile things, the most volatile asset classes out there-- Dogecoin, Bitcoin, you have AMC-- some of the hottest tickers on the site. And it's interesting because, you know, I think we can make the argument that trading activity has slowed down relative to the peak in January. People have returned to the office. They're out there working again. And yet, they're still logging on each morning, and they're checking some of these volatile asset classes in the hopes of potentially making a quick buck. JULIE HYMAN: Yeah, I mean, it makes sense, right, that the things that are the most volatile are the things that people check the most because they want to see where they are at that particular moment in time. And so, as Myles wrote in the Morning Brief, what we effectively see here is that these longer term trending tickers are really capturing the zeitgeist of the market right now. And those are the themes that we talked about. In fact, we talked about them, some at the top of the show. Cryptocurrencies on the one hand, meme stocks are another bucket that we tend to watch.

2021-05-21T12:34:12.000Z,Implied Volatility Surging for GameStop (GME) Stock Options,"Investors in GameStop Corp. GME need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Jul 16, 2021 $800.00 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.   Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy. Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for GameStop shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, GameStop is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the Retail - Consumer Electronics industry that ranks in the Top 37% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, no analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while four have dropped their estimates. The net effect has widened our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from a loss of 41 cents per share to a loss of 56 cents in that period. Given the way analysts feel about GameStop right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected. Check out the simple yet high-powered approach that Zacks Executive VP Kevin Matras has used to close recent double and triple-digit winners.

This has outpaced the Retail-Wholesale sector's loss of 4.09% and the S&P 500's loss of 0.41% in that time. GME will be looking to display strength as it nears its next earnings release. In that report, analysts expect GME to post earnings of -$0.56 per share. This would mark year-over-year growth of 65.22%. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $1.17 billion, up 14.63% from the prior-year quarter. GME's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of -$0.63 per share and revenue of $5.63 billion. These results would represent year-over-year changes of +70.56% and +10.69%, respectively. Any recent changes to analyst estimates for GME should also be noted by investors. These revisions typically reflect the latest short-term business trends, which can change frequently. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability. Based on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon. Our system takes these estimate changes into account and delivers a clear, actionable rating model. The Zacks Rank system, which ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. The Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 13.15% higher within the past month. GME currently has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold). The Retail - Consumer Electronics industry is part of the Retail-Wholesale sector. This industry currently has a Zacks Industry Rank of 91, which puts it in the top 36% of all 250+ industries.

Shares in GameStop, which was at the heart of the so-called ""stonks"" retail trading mania earlier this year, have risen by a third in the last one week, while shares in cinema operator AMC are up 39%. Ortex said short interest in AMC is currently estimated to be 18.3% of freefloat and in GME it is estimated at 21.8% of freefloat. Yesterday alone, short-sellers lost over $200 million each in both of those stocks, Ortex data shows. GameStop closed 13% higher at $180.6, the highest level since April 30.

2021-05-17T18:58:21.000Z,"UPDATE 2-Investment firms took positions on stocks hit by Archegos implosion, Gamestop","(Adds additional funds, details about GameStop) By Maiya Keidan May 17 (Reuters) - Several investment firms purchased shares in ViacomCBS Inc, Baidu and Discovery Inc , which made big market moves linked to the implosion of investment firm Archegos Capital Management, while others on Monday disclosed bets against retail-trading favorite GameStop Corp. A number of investment managers bet on companies that plummeted when large banks sold them in a hurry amid the collapse of Archegos at the end March. Other funds used the first quarter to take out put option positions, which are bearish bets, in GameStop. Gamestop was at the center of a battle earlier this year between retail investors who thought the ailing video retailer should trade higher and hedge funds like Melvin Capital, which bet that its stock would fall. Melvin Capital, which was badly hurt after holding bearish GameStop positions, did not disclose any put positions in its latest filing. Melvin's Gabriel Plotkin in February said he was wary about holding big short positions again. Regulatory filings show that Soros Fund Management and hedge funds HG Vora Capital Management and Coatue Management entered positions in media stock ViacomCBS Inc after disclosing no holdings in the previous quarter. The so-called 13F filings do not disclose the date the purchase was made but give a snapshot of what U.S. stocks fund managers owned at the end of the quarter. Archegos, a family office run by ex-Tiger Asia manager Bill Hwang, was highly exposed to ViacomCBS, leaving the firm to face a huge margin call from its prime broker banks, which in March were forced to sell large blocks of shares of ViacomCBS, media peer Discovery Inc and Chinese search giant Baidu . ViacomCBS plunged 57% in March while Discovery dropped 44% and Baidu fell 30%. Soros Fund Management, founded by billionaire George Soros, bought $194 million in ViacomCBS shares according to its filing https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1029160/000090266421002758/xslForm13F_X01/infotable.xml, while HG Vora picked up $78.9 million and Philippe Laffont's Coatue Management purchased $77.1 million over the same period.

2021-05-17T17:49:24.000Z,"AMC stock roars amid boost from Reddit, meme stock squeeze","Shares of movie theater chain AMC Entertainment (AMC) rallied in midday trading on Monday, following a surge last week and amid a renewed push on Reddit to squeeze short sellers. AMC, which was hit especially hard by COVID-19 lockdowns, is one of a group of heavily shorted so-called meme stocks — including GameStop (GME) and Bed Bath and Beyond (BBBY). Retail investors active on Reddit have bought up these stocks in an effort to force short sellers to buy them, as well to cover their losses — driving the companies' stock prices even higher. The theater chain— whose shares have spiked over 500% this year — started last week trading at $9.90, closed Thursday at $12.77, and hit a high of $14.38 on Monday, up over 5% on the day.  Taking advantage of the recent gains, the largest theater chain in the U.S. said last week that it had sold 43 million shares at $9.94 a share, raising a total of $428 million. That move came as the hashtag ""AMCsqueeze"" began trending on Twitter. The gains come after the movie theater chain was hammered by a global pandemic that resulted in a $4.59 billion loss in 2020 compared to $149 million the year prior. Recently, though, CEO Adam Aron suggested that AMC fared better than other movie theater chains.  During a call with analysts after reporting its first-quarter results earlier this month, Aron said its market share had ""soared"" by 25% compared to pre-pandemic levels.  “We’ve taken share from those who stayed closed or those who have gone bankrupt,” according to a Wall Street Journal report. Smaller chains like Alamo Drafthouse have filed for bankruptcy and closed a number of locations. AMC may also benefit from increased vaccination rates, with 37% of the U.S. population now fully vaccinated. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, predicted last month that Americans could potentially go to the movies without wearing masks by the fall or early winter.

2021-05-17T14:07:44.000Z,Meme Stocks Gain As AMC Squeeze Trends On Twitter,"By Dhirendra Tripathi Investing.com – AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC), GameStop (NYSE:GME) and Koss (NASDAQ:KOSS) all rose Monday amid indications that retail investors and the big institutional guys may be renewing their battle. #AMCSqueeze is among the top Twitter trends on Monday, an indication that it may again be experiencing a short squeeze, sending the shares higher. AMC and GameStop were both up around 6% while Koss was up 1% percent. If the session goes as it has so far for AMC, it would be the seventh consecutive day of gains for the stock. Last week, AMC wrapped up raising $428 million in fresh equity. The company raised that money before commissions and fees at an average price of $9.94 per share. AMC crossed $14 today earlier during the session, fired up on hopes that people will flock to its multiplex screens as movies are released in theaters after more than a year. GameStop, the favorite of the retail investors last five months, may be trading 64% off its year’s high but it’s still some 127 times the 52-week low. Its efforts at reinventing itself into an online retailer is keeping some believers still glued. Meme stocks have a devoted following that acquired cult status in January when some Reddit followers decided to take on the big hedge funds in the GameStop short squeeze. That unexpected coming together resulted in at least one hedge fund going bankrupt.

The Tesla (TSLA) boss, who has previously said his Dogecoin tweets shouldn't be taken seriously, tweeted that he was ""working with doge devs to improve system transaction efficiency"" and said the work was ""potentially promising."" The cryptocurrency, which was conceived as a joke in 2013, rose over 30% on Friday morning following Musk's tweet. It was trading at $0.53, having reached as high as $0.56. Billionaire Musk has been a staunch supporter of the meme token and frequently tweets about it. Recently he tweeted that he planned to take Doge to ""the moon"" on a SpaceX rocket in 2022. The ""DOGE-1 Mission to the Moon"" is in collaboration with Canadian company, Geometric Energy Corporation. Musk's attention has led to increased interest from crypto trading platforms and investors. Last week, popular exchange Gemini announced support for Dogecoin, following a similar move by rival eToro. The crypto has risen over 1,500% since the start of the year largely thanks to Musk's attention. It is now the fourth-most valued coin with a market cap to over $70bn, according to CoinMarket.

Analysts had expected the SpaceX founder to mention the crypto on the show and send prices spiking. Instead, his plug saw the coin plummet almost 25%. Musk previously hinted that he was looking into alternative cryptos that Tesla could accept, asking his 54.5 million Twitter (TWTR) followers whether Tesla should accept Doge as payment. While Musk is warming to Dogecoin, the entrepreneur is souring on bitcoin. On Thursday, he sent Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies on a downward spiral after suddenly pulling Tesla's support. Tesla's unexpected move came as Musk said he was worried over the environmental impact of bitcoin mining.  Watch: What are the risks of investing in cryptocurrency?

2021-05-13T17:54:19.000Z,"Column: Bitcoin, dogecoin, NFTs, GameStop — is this the peak of investment absurdity?","The textbooks say that the securities markets exist to facilitate raising capital so that companies can thrive. In today's investment world, that notion seems almost quaint. Business news pages and cable shows are dominated by fads — be it bitcoin, dogecoin or nonfungible tokens (NFTs) — and stocks whose prices are not tied to sober reflections about their issuers' prospects but rocket up and down based on internet-fueled speculation. Looking back at this period in a decade, we'll say there was a lot of mania, but we might be surprised at what turned out to be valuable, and what didn't. Frank Partnoy, UC Berkeley ""There are so many bubbles out there that I can't even write about them all,"" says Susan Webber, an investment advisor who as ""Yves Smith"" tracks business mishaps and misdeeds on her website Naked Capitalism. ""They're so loony."" Have we reached peak absurdity in the financial markets? Among the drivers of some of this action are figures one can describe only as ""influencers."" They include traders who can stampede herds of followers through tips on internet message boards, and also Elon Musk. The chief executive of Tesla Inc. has more than 54 million followers on Twitter. Many are true believers in Musk's personal hobbyhorses, which include the near-term advent of self-driving cars and the populating of Mars as a second home for the human race. That the mercurial Musk's tweets can whipsaw investment prices became evident in just the last few days. Late Wednesday, Musk announced on Twitter that Tesla, reversing an earlier policy, would not accept bitcoin as payment for its cars. The announcement drove bitcoin's price down by about 16%, to $46,000, in the space of two hours before it recovered to about $48,200, where it sits as of this writing, according to Coinbase. A few days earlier, a ""Saturday Night Live"" character played by Musk, the show's host for the week, declared dogecoin a ""hustle.""

This change was narrower than the S&P 500's 2.15% loss on the day. Coming into today, shares of the video game retailer had gained 4.21% in the past month. In that same time, the Retail-Wholesale sector lost 1.65%, while the S&P 500 gained 0.7%. Investors will be hoping for strength from GME as it approaches its next earnings release. On that day, GME is projected to report earnings of -$0.56 per share, which would represent year-over-year growth of 65.22%. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $1.17 billion, up 14.63% from the year-ago period. GME's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of -$0.63 per share and revenue of $5.63 billion. These results would represent year-over-year changes of +70.56% and +10.69%, respectively. Investors might also notice recent changes to analyst estimates for GME. These revisions typically reflect the latest short-term business trends, which can change frequently. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook. Our research shows that these estimate changes are directly correlated with near-term stock prices. To benefit from this, we have developed the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system. The Zacks Rank system, which ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988.

2021-05-12T14:43:00.000Z,Is There A Huge Naked Short on Helium Explorer Avanti Energy?,"Aggressive short sellers, now being targeted by Canadian regulators, are believed to have shorted a shocking 11 million shares of helium miner Avanti Energy in Canada since 2019, most of it in the past two months alone. That makes Avanti Energy a large target of short-sellers seeking to enrich themselves by destroying companies, even as Canadian regulators are about to tighten the screws on these out-of-control—and naked—shorts. Buyins.com, which allows companies and investors to see what’s really going on in the markets--recently put out a shocking report on Avanti, showing that since 2019, 924,000 total shares have been shorted in the U.S. and around 11 million total shares have been shorted in Canada. Which is surprising considering the company has a fairly low share count and what seem to be sound fundamentals. But most of that—an astonishing 95%+ has happened just since March 2021. The charts below show the whole picture: If the Buyins.com report is accurate, it shows that an abnormally large percentage of daily trading volume, 64.91%, is short selling. So let’s look at the numbers from their report: In Canadian trading (TSXV: AVN) approximately 11 million total shares have been shorted at approximately C$1.68. Additionally, looking at the short data available to the public, there are no huge shorts, which indicates that the 11 million total shares shorted is happening predominantly at the market maker level. Market makers claim the market maker’s exemption when short selling. This can account for larger volumes of short selling than is reported publicly (total short interest). If normal market-making suggests that 25% of daily trading volume is short selling, 64.91% is egregious. That’s where the regulators will have to step in, and the timing couldn’t be better with a new push to quash naked short selling that is destroying capital markets. Regulators should now be looking at the trading action to see if there are illegal trades going on and work with the banks to check everything is above board.
