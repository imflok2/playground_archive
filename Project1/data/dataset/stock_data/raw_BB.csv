2021-06-08T17:31:25.000Z,GameStop stock sent higher by meme trading army ahead of earnings,"The meme stock army is showing its support for the OG of the 2021 retail trading movement — GameStop (GME) — ahead of the company's earnings on Wednesday evening. Shares of GameStop rose as much as 6% to $292 in afternoon trading on Tuesday as fast-money traders positioned themselves prior to the earnings release. GameStop was among the top five most commented stocks on social media, according to data from social monitoring service HypeEquity. Talk on social media of call options on GameStop — or a bet on the stock rising in the short-term — outpaced chatter of put options by a five-to-one ratio.  HypeEquity data shows traders keen on pushing GameStop's stock above $300 before earnings hit the tape.  Over on SwaggyStocks, another social media tracking platform, GameStop's stock was the fourth most commented on ticker on Reddit's WallStreetBets page. Positive mentions on the stock outnumbered negative mentions by six times. It's clear meme traders continue to overlook the present fundamental state of GameStop (which is bad). Instead they appear to be staying true to large shareholder and soon-to-be chairman Ryan Cohen (aka Chewy co-founder) outlining some form of revitalization plan for the chain in 2021. Speaking to GameStop's fundamentals, here is what Wall Street expects from the retailer in the first quarter. Note that the Bloomberg compiled consensus estimates only reflect projections from three analysts. Most sell-side analysts have dropped coverage of GameStop given the heightened volatility of its stock during the meme army's uprising.  Net Sales: $1.17 billion, up 14.6% from a year ago Adjusted Operating Profits: loss of $67 million vs. a loss of $98.8 million a year ago Adjusted Diluted EPS: loss of 71 cents vs. loss of $1.61 a year ago One of those analysts that recently pulled coverage on GameStop owing to insane levels of volatility is Bank of America's Curtis Nagle. ""Non-fundamental factors are still driving GameStop shares,"" Nagle said in a research note to clients.

2021-06-08T15:59:58.000Z,Wendy's just became the first fast-food meme stock — but there is a catchYahoo Finance,"Beloved burger and Frosty chain Wendy's (WEN) has won the honor of being the first fast-food stock to get roped into the red-hot meme stock trade. Shares of Wendy's spiked 16% in early afternoon trading on Tuesday after a favorable mention by traders on Reddit. The Wendy's ticker page was the second most trafficked on the Yahoo Finance platform, behind other meme crowd favorite Clover Health (whose stock popped 55% out of nowhere). Wendy's stock outperformed the slight decline in meme stock darling AMC Entertainment and a 6% rise in the OG of meme trading, GameStop (which reports earnings on Wednesday).  ""We’re aware of the unusual trading activity this morning and we’re closely monitoring,"" a Wendy's spokesperson told Yahoo Finance.  There are at least two striking things with the out of left field move in Wendy's shares Tuesday.  First, only 4.64% of the company's outstanding shares are sold short, according to Yahoo Finance Plus data. That runs counter to the high short position stocks that have characterized this year's meme stock trade. In other words, Wall Street is in no way betting against the future of Wendy's, dissimilar to GameStop and AMC.  And that brings us to the second point. The reason why Wall Street doesn't hate Wendy's is that unlike other meme stocks, Wendy's is a fundamentally sound business that is growing.  Wendy's U.S. same-store sales in the first quarter surged 13.5%, powered by diners heading back out after getting their COVID-19 vaccine and trying the chain's new breakfast menu. Digital ordering and a push into more premium chicken sandwiches also lit a fire under first quarter sales. Wendy's same-store sales internationally rose 7.9%. The Dave Thomas creation almost beat out McDonald's U.S.'s 13.6% same-store sales increase in the quarter, the latter of which could be seen as a letdown considering it launched three new chicken sandwiches. Same-store sales for Burger King in the U.S. rose 6.6% in the quarter.

MYLES UDLAND: But let's begin our coverage this morning of the market with the story that remains the story. See it there? I love that animation. Meme madness in the market here. AMC, GameStop, of course really the two leading-- we'll call them the leading members of this act, this play, leading cast members of this performance we see happening in the market. But this morning, really, the chaos continues to spread. Wendy's the latest name to get involved. There's now a fast food angle to the stay-at-home trade. If we go all the way back in time to February of 2020, when Wallstreetbets first really became a driving force of conversation around the stock market-- so this was just on the eve of when the market's concern turned to full COVID all the time. We had a big ""Bloomberg Businessweek"" story about getting tendies and about buying call options. YOLO call options really were birthed with that story. Luke Kawa over at Bloomberg writing that. Luke, unfortunately, has since moved on to the dark side, asset management. But we have seen with Wendy's this morning, guys, literal tendies. Their nuggets are excellent, the spicy nuggets, of course. Don't get the regular ones. That's all in the market. And at this point, I mean, where do we begin? Sozzi, let's start with you because you actually cover Wendy's as a fundamental story. Do you have any updates for us there? Anything that we can point to on this? Or is it just the latest ticker to get Redditized here in this market? BRIAN SOZZI: Well, first off, yes, that is in fact correct. Wendy's got, what they say, touted on the Reddit stream early this morning. Also had my former boss Jim Cramer out there, doing his thing, touting Wendy's as well. But I hate to be the bearer of bad news here. But to the meme traders, there's actually a fundamental story to Wendy's. And they're coming off a pretty good first quarter a couple of weeks ago. I talked to CEO Todd Penegor. He tells me they are looking to go from 8,000 restaurants by 2025 from about 7,000 now, a billion-dollar-plus breakfast business probably over the next year.

2021-06-08T17:36:18.000Z,Clover Health Roars to Record as Short Sellers Get BurnedBloomberg,"(Bloomberg) -- Clover Health Inc., a health insurer backed by venture capitalist Chamath Palihapitiya, posted a second day of wild gains that appear to be driven by retail investors determined to punish short-sellers betting against it. Clover rallied 72% at 1:25 p.m. in New York trading after briefly doubling. The gains erased five months of losses in the stock -- which formed part of a broader selloff in Palihapitiya-backed companies -- in just two days. Trading volume in Clover was more than 22 times the three-month daily average on Tuesday, with a record 559 million shares changing hands. The sudden flurry of demand comes after retail traders realized that short-sellers had been swelling their bets against Clover, a move that left them vulnerable if the stock were to start rallying. On the Reddit forum WallStreetBets, chatter has built this week on the potential for a short-squeeze in the stock, following similar successful ploys on meme stocks including Workhorse Group Inc. and Richard Branson’s space exploration company Virgin Galactic, which advanced 19% and 5.6%, respectively. Bearish bets in Clover have been steadily climbing since March and now stand at over $570 million or 42% of the public float, according to data from S3 Partners. Daytraders also touted the stock’s potential inclusion into the Russell indices -- a rebalancing of those benchmarks is expected toward the end of June.

Short sellers were down about $465 million on today’s move for a year-to-date loss of $517 million, he said. Clover declined to comment on the moves.

2021-06-08T05:35:16.000Z,Meme Stocks Set To Extend Gains Tuesday,"By Dhirendra Tripathi Investing.com — Meme stocks, led by AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC), looked set to extend their gains for the second consecutive session rising 2%-5% in premarket Tuesday. The favorite of the Reddit gang, AMC, was up more than 4% while GameStop (NYSE:GME) and BlackBerry (NYSE:BB) gained approximately 2% and 3%, respectively. Meme stocks have defied the naysayers consistently over the last six months and while GameStop and Blackberry (TSX:BB) may be significantly off their year’s highs, it’s not been a flash in the pan. In the process, the stocks have made new highs several times and created wealth for many even as their books may not yet deserve those valuations. The companies are trying though. To the surprise of many, AMC has raised $1.24 billion in equity in three installments in less than a month, each at a different price, and proposes to sell 25 million more shares in 2022. GameStop, once a bankruptcy candidate, has reshuffled its top management as it tries to become a multichannel global retailer, retired part of its debt and created new facilities. Blackberry continues to strengthen its security software portfolio, have more cloud-based offerings and forge new partnerships.

Shares of the theater chain rose as much as 10%, adding to Monday’s 15% gain and continuing what’s been a wild ride for investors. Wendy’s jumped as much as 19% to notch a record as the fast-food restaurant operator gained traction on social media, including several touts on Reddit’s WallStreetBets forum. So-called meme stocks broadly gained Monday. Clover Health Investments Corp. also rallied as it was among the most mentioned companies in Stocktwits over the last day. The Chamath Palihapitiya-backed health insurer surged as much as 59%, the most ever, after Monday’s 32% advance. Clover Health short interest as a percentage of float is about 42%, data from financial analytics firm S3 Partners show. “The power of the network effect of social media entices more people to get involved, so then they start broadening their horizons, looking for other names that have high short interest and things like that,” said Michael O’Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading. GameStop Corp., the original icon among retail traders, surged as much as 21% to the highest in almost three months ahead of quarterly earnings results, which are expected Wednesday. MKM Partners analyst Eric Handler said in a note Tuesday that AMC should focus on debt reduction with its newly raised capital rather than acquisitions. He rates the stock sell with a $1 price target. “Management has been gifted an unforeseen opportunity from the recent wave of (fanatical) retail investor momentum, which has pushed the shares far above historical valuation levels,” Handler wrote. AMC company insiders have continued to take advantage of the stock’s run-up in price. Board member Howard Koch Jr. divested more than $790,000 of shares on Monday, according to a filing with the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission.

ALEXIS CHRISTOFOROUS: I want to continue our discussion on the markets now and bring in Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National. Art, good to see you. I want to stick with these meme stocks and the fact that a lot of investors might not even know they own these stocks because they're part of the Russell 2000 Small Cap Value Index. I'm talking about AMC and GameStop among them. What do regular investors who don't want to play the meme game need to know about what's going on in that space right now? ART HOGAN: Yeah, it's such a great question, Alexis. And I think that-- I think you and Jared hit it right in the last section, where he said it's its own animal. And you said it's a frenzy, right? So understand that that's what's going on right now. It's a separate sideshow. It is its own animal. It is a frenzy. It's a mania. But if you are along the Russell 2000, the IWM, part of the movement you've seen in the Russell 2000 has been because of companies like AMC and GameStop. And that will continue to be the case until they reconstitute that index. And actually, these names are going to get kicked out because they're too large. This is the function of if they're going to be put into the Russell 1,000, right? So that's what happens once a year, where it just so happens that that's happening this month. But in the near term, understand that if there's a handful of meme stocks that are rotating in and out of favor, it could have a potential move on the Russell 2000. But understand very small, the percentage that AMC or GameStop, back in the day when GameStop was the only game in town. In meme land, I think that that had a bit of a move on the Russell, too. But I think the Russell, too, really has been driven. Because it's domestically focused, focused on the US economy. Small cap tend to be cyclical. There's a lot of energy and financials in there. So I think there's a lot more fundamental drivers for the Russell 2000 right now versus that poll that has been the meme stock frenzy.

But one Wall Street strategist is warning investors that the ""hot vax summer"" for stocks ""might feel a little cold and rocky."" Callie Cox, senior investment strategist at Ally Invest, explained on Yahoo Finance Live that the summer is a historically weak period for stocks. Volume typically trails off as investors leave the office and hit the roads.  ""[W]e could see lower volume in the stock market. And lower volume typically leads to a wandering market, especially with the environment we're in, where investors are kind of looking around the corner and saying, 'what's next? What's the ominous thing on the outlook?' And they're feeling a little more hesitant about putting their money in stocks,"" she said. This doesn't preclude market strength or necessarily mean we'll see weakness this summer. Cox pointed out that since 1990, the S&P 500 has risen an average of 0.9% between Memorial Day and Labor Day. But that compares to an average of 3.6% for the months before Memorial Day and 4.2% for the months after Labor Day. ""Stocks have bucked the trend recently, though, with five straight summers of gains (including the S&P 500’s 16% gains last summer). And the market’s path of least resistance is higher,"" she said.  Earlier this year, Cox told Yahoo Finance that year two of a new bull market typically sees more muted returns than those of the first year, which tend to be higher. Despite the general market strength, investors should still exercise caution. In a separate statement to Yahoo Finance, she writes, ""In a (relatively) low-volume environment, bad news tends to hit a hit harder, and small shifts in buying or selling could lead to noticeable market swings. Investors are extra skittish these days, too. We can tell the market’s mindset has changed from 'What could go right?' to 'What could go wrong?,' and that’s led to quick selling on surprise headlines.""

2021-06-07T18:17:49.000Z,Reddit’s WallStreetBets has a new favorite stock,"GameStop and AMC are trading at levels no one could have imagined a year ago. Now, Reddit’s r/WallStreetBets community is looking for the next company whose stock is set to explode—and seems to have settled on Blackberry. The company behind the once iconic line of pagers and smartphones has seen its shares increase 137% year to date. That’s nothing compared to the 1,472% increase in GameStop and the 2,705% bump for AMC, but it’s the biggest surge the company has seen in two years. And, judging by chatter on r/WallStreetBets, interest is growing. A look at the subreddit Monday finds seven of the top 20 posts are dedicated solely to Blackberry. (Four others are focused on praising Clover Health Investments.) The stock is currently trading in the $15-$16 range, but the most enthusiastic investors are hoping to see it hit $50. “Don’t stop, BBelieving!!” encouraged user TehlorO. Meanwhile, user Substantial_Diver_34 showed a screenshot of what he says is his portfolio that is 100% committed to Blackberry, with over 6,400 shares. It was, at the time of the shot, down $14,000. The post is entitled “What have I done?” Other users gave nothing but encouragement. “I'll tell you what you've done: You've guaranteed your place amongst the millionares,” wrote kingandr3, while Firesice offered “You put in a winning bid...just needs a little time.” WSB bulls say Blackberry has grown from being a phone company to a cybersecurity firm that has deals with [hotlink]Amazon[/hotlink] and others and could be well positioned to take a position in the electric vehicle marketspace. Analysts aren’t as sure. Four firms currently have “Sell” ratings on the company, with only one suggesting investors buy. Of course, the r/WallStreetBets effect often defies the logic of analysts. AMC and [hotlink]GameStop[/hotlink] were floundering a year ago. Now, their stock prices and market caps have increased so much in recent months that they could join the Russell 1000 by the end of the month.

2021-06-07T19:37:29.000Z,Meme Stock Bulls Take Back Control as Hedge Fund Battle RagesFX Empire,"After a wave of selling heading into the weekend, retail investors have wrestled back control of their favorite shorted stocks, including AMC Entertainment and GameStop. The stocks are off their highs of the day, and retail investors are convinced that something shady is going on. Short sellers are swinging back after losing USD 2.2 billion from AMC’s rally last week. There are theories of traders pulling out all the stops — including the illegal practice of naked shorting, which is currently trending on Twitter. Shares of AMC have galloped 16% today but still failed to cross the psychologically important USD 60 level, where the movie chain stock closed above on June 2 for the first time. While AMC might be off its peak, investors don’t have much to clamor about considering that the stock has skyrocketed more than 467% since early May. Fellow WallStreetBets stock GameStop is tacking on close to 11% in today’s session. The stock has gained more than 1,400% year-to-date for a market cap of USD 19.4 billion. GameStop investors have proven to be a loyal bunch as it hasn’t always been easy to hold. But those who have stuck around continue to be rewarded with more potential runway for gains. Ihor Dusaniwsky, managing director of predictive analytics at S3 Partners, revealed in a tweet that GMC and AMC each have a short squeeze risk score attached of 10 out of a possible 10. Meanwhile, the WallStreetBets crowd has taken over Twitter, with #nakedshorting trending on the social media site. To be clear, unlike regular shorting, which is legal, naked selling is not legal.

2021-06-08T05:35:16.000Z,Meme Stocks Set To Extend Gains TuesdayInvesting.com,"By Dhirendra Tripathi Investing.com — Meme stocks, led by AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC), looked set to extend their gains for the second consecutive session rising 2%-5% in premarket Tuesday. The favorite of the Reddit gang, AMC, was up more than 4% while GameStop (NYSE:GME) and BlackBerry (NYSE:BB) gained approximately 2% and 3%, respectively. Meme stocks have defied the naysayers consistently over the last six months and while GameStop and Blackberry (TSX:BB) may be significantly off their year’s highs, it’s not been a flash in the pan. In the process, the stocks have made new highs several times and created wealth for many even as their books may not yet deserve those valuations. The companies are trying though. To the surprise of many, AMC has raised $1.24 billion in equity in three installments in less than a month, each at a different price, and proposes to sell 25 million more shares in 2022. GameStop, once a bankruptcy candidate, has reshuffled its top management as it tries to become a multichannel global retailer, retired part of its debt and created new facilities. Blackberry continues to strengthen its security software portfolio, have more cloud-based offerings and forge new partnerships.

2021-06-07T13:39:06.000Z,Investors buying meme stocks need to be ready for downside risks: strategist,"JJ Kinahan, TD Ameritrade Chief Market Strategist, joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss why more investors are buying meme stocks this year and the potential risks of buying GameStop and AMC Entertainment. MYLES UDLAND: OK, joining us now to talk about the state of the markets and how retail has been playing this market is JJ Kinahan. He's the Chief Market Strategist over at TD Ameritrade. So JJ, right before you came on, you heard us talking about what's happening with the meme names. You guys have your latest survey out of what your investors have moved in and out of the most. And a name that I did not see on that list was AMC. What have you seen on your side in some of these big names that really constitute kind of the core of the meme trade? JJ KINAHAN: Sure. So you know, if you think about it, AMC, GameStop, et cetera, for the last month wasn't necessarily as big a story. It became a bigger story right at the end of the month. What was interesting to me is when I looked at those stocks is that the week before Memorial-- so Memorial Day was a week ago today, it was last week on Tuesday that we really saw these explode. The week before, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday is when we actually saw our clients start to buy those names more. On Tuesday and Wednesday, our clients were more even in terms of their buying and selling of the stocks. So I thought that that part was really, really interesting overall. Obviously, the interest increased pretty significantly. Actually the one name that you didn't talk about but I know is part of the picture-- and just, you guys, it was a great discussion, had a lot to cover there-- was BlackBerry. BlackBerry was a name that in terms of percentage-wise, the volume picked up very significantly. Because GameStop and AMC continue to have this sort of interest all the time. And I thought it was interesting, you know, Julia was comparing some of this when we go down and people come in and buy it, to Tesla. And you know, and the stocks our clients purchased last month, Tesla was one of them, because they did sell off. And I think there was a little bit of a difference-- and it's one of the things you guys were talking about-- and that I also believe in talking to our clients that there's a belief that AMC is also a reopening play as much as a meme stock play, because people think that there is a hunger for movies and good movies, and people like the theater experience.

2021-06-07T13:33:13.000Z,Surging meme stocks like AMC and GameStop send Russell 2000 skyrocketing,"Meme stock mania has been mighty kind to the small-cap Russell 2000 Index after its reconstitution last June.  The total market capitalization of the Russell 2000 Index surged 84% from last year’s reconstitution (or the addition and subtraction of new companies to the index) to $3.5 trillion, FTSE Russell said in weekend tweet. This year alone, the Russell 2000 is up more than 16% compared to a 12% gain for the S&P 500. ""In 2020, overall capitalization for the U.S. equity market stayed fairly flat, decreasing by 1%. However, we’ve seen a surge in growth in the first half of 2021 with the total market cap in the Russell 1000 reaching $44.1 trillion. We have also seen a resurgence in market capitalizations of small cap companies in the Russell 2000 reflecting the overall bounce back of U.S. equity markets following the COVID-19 recession in early 2020,"" said FTSE Russell CEO Arne Staal. To be sure, the index has been powered by massive gains in popular stocks among a new army of retail trades such as AMC (AMC) and GameStop (GME).  AMC shares have gained more than 700% in one-year's time, giving the money-losing movie theater chain a whopping $25 billion market cap. As for struggling GameStop, its stock has exploded 4,900% over the past year — it now sports a lofty $17.6 billion market cap. Given each company's bulging market caps, they are likely to be removed from the Russell 1000. The index typically showcases companies with sub $5 billion market caps.  Currently, the smallest company in the Russell 2000 Index is Velocity Financial (VEL). It boasts a market cap of $257.1 million, an increase of 171.2% from $94.8 million in 2020.  FTSE Russell's changes to its various indexes will take place after U.S. stock markets close on June 25. The company points out the reconstitution will impact more than $10.6 trillion in investor assets benchmarked to, or invested in, products based on the Russell U.S. indexes.

2021-06-07T13:27:28.000Z,"Meme stock favorites start the week higher, GameStop earnings in focus","Yahoo Finance's Myles Udland, Julie Hyman and Brian Sozzi break down how meme stocks are faring ahead of this week's inflation data. JULIE HYMAN: Well, as we look ahead to that inflation data, as we saw last week, markets abhor a vacuum, a news vacuum. And so one of the things that leapt into the breach were meme stocks last week and AMC in particular, as we saw that stock rise-- I think 86% was the final tally when all was said and done, even with a dip late in the week. the shares are up another 4.5% here this morning. Myles, I'm sure you were doing some deep thinking on the meme stock front over the course of the weekend and whether we would continue to see a lot of this action. I don't know that we know what exactly sparked the rally that we saw last week or the renewed interest in it, but it doesn't feel like that it's necessarily going away. MYLES UDLAND: No, I think the more that I think about it, the more that we cover these meme stocks as, really, the most interesting sub-story within the market-- because all the conversation we were just having with Brian and the direction of the economy, that's heady stuff. That is where the base of the trajectory for all of this is really formed. But the activity with meme stocks underneath the surface and the fact that it has now come up in essentially the same form a couple of times within three months-- and yet, as we discussed with Jared last week, and I'm sure we'll talk about as we get through this week, the lack of spillover between what's happened in the meme names and how sentiment within the broader market is reflected, I think, to me is the most instructive part of this story right now. I know there were a few stories out from a variety of publications over the weekend about the index industry and how some of the rally in the meme names opens that up to distortions within the construction of the index. Because obviously, if you have a market-cap-weighted index or market-cap-weighted type fund, and AMC is now double the size that it was, quadruple the size that it was, it can move that index or fund around a little bit more. Of course, if you're talking about the Russell 2000 or you're talking about even a sector-level index, its weighting is going to be still in the fractions of percentage points.

In the case of AMC, the hottest of them for now, traders may be trying to gauge where the company is headed. After raising $1.24 billion in equity in three installments in less than a month, each at a different price, it filed a preliminary proxy on Thursday seeking permission to sell 25 million more shares in 2022. It has been a roller-coaster for AMC traders who saw their stock double in just one session on Wednesday to hit a high of $83.63, only to fall in double digits on announcement of a new equity raise. The shares closed at $66.80 Friday. The pandemic has caused AMC's long-term debt levels to soar to $5.4 billion as of the first three months of this year from less than $2 billion in 2016. And it’s still losing money, with analysts expecting another $100 million to go over the next 12 months.

But for those who want to ride the wave of what's trending, there's an ETF for that, the recently launched FOMO ETF. Joining me now to discuss is Matthew Tuttle. He is CEO and CIO of Tuttle Capital Management. Thanks so much for joining me today, Matthew. MATTHEW TUTTLE: Thank you for having me. ALISSA CORAM: So first of all, FOMO is definitely a catchy phrase out there right now, the fear of missing out. And I think many investors experience that. Sound investing is based on rules. But emotion is also a very big part of investing. So give us your take on how investors can actually use this FOMO to their advantage. MATTHEW TUTTLE: Yeah, so there's so much going on right now in markets, more than we've ever seen. So you've got the meme stocks. You've got the crypto. You've got the value stocks. So what FOMO is designed to do is allow investors to get access to all of those areas. And then going forward, whatever it happens to be the hot area, because it's going to change over time, but to do it in a smarter way. So we're going to have the GameStops. We're going to have the AMCs. We're going to have some of the Bitcoin things and the blockchain things. But we're going got weight those according to downside volatility so we're never going to have a situation where we're in a whole bunch of stuff in large amounts that gets you crushed.

More importantly, it could be the only fuel on earth that produces zero emissions when burned. Until recently, this remarkable fuel was considered too dangerous and expensive to be used commercially… But a new technological breakthrough appears to have made the adoption of this super fuel much more likely. And one little-known company – Headed by an ex NASA Engineer - AmmPower Corp. (CSE:AMMP; OTC: AMMPF) – appears to be miles ahead of the competition… In a market that’s projected to grow to over $81 billion. Not a bad position to be in when the DOE has expressed its commitment to continued research for the comprehensive development, demonstration, and commercialization of this energy source. This up-and-coming energy source harnesses the second-most widely used inorganic chemical in the world… So supply shouldn’t be an issue. But getting your hands on the technology that makes this all possible… well we think that is no easy task. HARNESSING A RENEWABLE ENERGY SOURCE THAT MAY BE 3X MORE POWERFUL -- AND CLEANER -- THAN GASOLINE Throughout the history of the energy industry, new--more powerful--sources of energy have started off small … and then come to dominate the industry for a time. From coal ... to petroleum ... to natural gas... And now, renewables. Each new energy source had a scientific problem to overcome before widespread adoption. With coal, the advancement of the steam engine in the 19th century dramatically improved the efficiency of coal mining and transport during the Industrial Revolution. With petroleum, the Scottish chemist James Young devised a method to refine paraffin from crude oil for easy transport. With natural gas, it was being able to cool it to -160° C to form Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) so it could be used for profitable and safe transportation in ships.

The stocks are off their highs of the day, and retail investors are convinced that something shady is going on. Short sellers are swinging back after losing USD 2.2 billion from AMC’s rally last week. There are theories of traders pulling out all the stops — including the illegal practice of naked shorting, which is currently trending on Twitter. Shares of AMC have galloped 16% today but still failed to cross the psychologically important USD 60 level, where the movie chain stock closed above on June 2 for the first time. While AMC might be off its peak, investors don’t have much to clamor about considering that the stock has skyrocketed more than 467% since early May. Fellow WallStreetBets stock GameStop is tacking on close to 11% in today’s session. The stock has gained more than 1,400% year-to-date for a market cap of USD 19.4 billion. GameStop investors have proven to be a loyal bunch as it hasn’t always been easy to hold. But those who have stuck around continue to be rewarded with more potential runway for gains. Ihor Dusaniwsky, managing director of predictive analytics at S3 Partners, revealed in a tweet that GMC and AMC each have a short squeeze risk score attached of 10 out of a possible 10. Meanwhile, the WallStreetBets crowd has taken over Twitter, with #nakedshorting trending on the social media site. To be clear, unlike regular shorting, which is legal, naked selling is not legal. It has to do with selling shares that have not been issued yet. Nonetheless, it still happens in the market. Naked shorting is how 140% of GameStop’s float can have short interest, as pointed out by Charles Payne on Fox Business.

2021-06-04T19:38:07.000Z,BB Stock Is a Steal If Blackberry Maintains Free Cash Flow,"Blackberry (NYSE:BB) could become a bargain stock this year if the company keeps producing large amounts of free cash flow (FCF). Even though BB stock has skyrocketed in the past month, I estimate it could be worth 32% more. That puts its value at $20.91 per share. Source: Paul McKinnon/Shutterstock.com This is based on its FCF generation. Last year the company made $82 million in cash flow from operations (CFFO). This can be seen on page 7 of its recent earnings report. After deducting the $8 million in capital expenses (capex) during the year ending Feb 2021, its FCF was $74 million. That works out to a FCF margin of 8.28% of its $893 million in sales during the year. However, looking more closely at what happened last year I decided to revise my model. For example, Seeking Alpha shows that during its fourth quarter, Blackberry generated $52 million in CFFO and spent $3 million on capex. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Therefore, its FCF during Q4 was $49 million, or a huge 23.33% of its $210 million in revenue during the quarter. That is a much higher FCF margin than the 2020 average of 8.28%. 7 Best Vaccine Stocks for Their Pipeline Potential Assuming this high FCF margin maintains this rate, we can estimate Blackberry’s value. For example, analysts estimate that by Feb 2023, about 1.5 years from now, sales will hit $958 million. So using a 23.33% FCF margin, Blackberry will produce $223.5 million in FCF that year. Most high-tech stocks trade at an FCF yield of between 1% to 3%. This is calculated by dividing the free cash flow estimates by its yield number. Let’s use a 1.5% FCF yield in our calculations. For example, using $223.5 million in FCF forecast for Blackberry in 2023, brings its value to $14.9 billion. This is 73.65% above today’s market value for Blackberry of $8.58 billion. However, we need to adjust the FCF number first. Remember this is for the year ending Feb. 2023. That is 1.5 years from now. Using a 10% discount rate over 1.5 years, the present value discount factor is 86.68%. Therefore, the $223.5 million in FCF works out to $193.73 million in present value FCF.

2021-06-04T17:28:45.000Z,This meme stock exploded 62% in one day and this Wall Street analyst has had enough,"Hat tip to you, Bank of America analyst Curtis Nagle for adhering to some very basic principles of investing, which still matter even though meme stock traders couldn't care less about valuation methodologies, free cash flow outlooks or margin structures.  After seeing Bed Bath & Beyond (BBY) shares explode 62% on June 2, Nagle said in a research note on Friday that it's time for him step back from the volatile stock.  ""This [move in the stock] comes in the context of no significant updates from Bed Bath & Beyond or any other material news. Bed Bath & Beyond did release a press release on 6/2/21 regarding the launch of three new private label brands but this was already expected by investors and is not material, in our view. Instead we believe that the rapid appreciation in Bed Bath & Beyond's shares is being driven by another surge in interest and trading led by retail investors,"" Nagle said. ""This follows a very large but short-term move in late January of this year. We also note that Bed Bath & Beyond's share price increase corresponds to big moves over the past week with ""meme stocks"" such as GameStop, AMC and BlackBerry. As a result, we move to No Rating as we believe shares of Bed Bath & Beyond are no longer trading on fundamentals. Investors should no longer rely upon our previous investment opinion or price objective.""  Nagle isn't the first sell-side analyst this year to remove a rating or price target — or just outright drop coverage — of a company swept up into meme stock mania. Even still, as this former analyst could attest these are drastic actions that are far from the norm among the analyst community on Wall Street. It's a group that prides itself on making great calls after conducting granular research and maintaining good relationships with executive teams.   But the surprise maneuvers do underscore how impossible it is for an analyst to properly cover a company — which includes talking with management, modeling out future earnings and communicating those things to clients —amid an environment fast-filling up with a new generation of retail traders. In this topsy turvy backdrop, a veteran analyst could go from being a hero one day to being out of a job tomorrow simply because a CEO like Adam Aron of AMC conducts an interview with a YouTube influencer.

2021-06-04T16:40:19.000Z,"Wall Street Bets: Meme Stocks AMC, BB Take Investors on Roller Coaster Ride","Investors have gone along for the ride, vowing to hold on until they put the final nail in the coffin of short-sellers. Despite the volatility, shares of AMC Entertainment, in particular, have already almost doubled in price this week despite Thursday’s decline of close to 20%. AMC appears to be the tide lifting the meme-stock boat as other names including MicroVision, BlackBerry, Bed Bath & Beyond, Koss Corp and GameStop have either flipped green or are off their lows of the day. Wall Street analysts are doing the best they can keeping up with the WallStreetBets movement, which has seen individual investors gain influence in the stock market rally. Most recently, Wedbush Securities has shown its true colors, which apparently is a gray area. After shares of AMC touched on USD 60 this week, the firm lifted its price target on the stock by USD 1 to USD 7.50. At the same time, however, Wedbush analyst Alicia Reese also suggested a “justified price target” would be “as high as USD 10,” saying in a report, “AMC has made the best of its current ‘Meme Stock’ status by selling shares at a premium, and has raised significant capital doing so.” Another meme stock that is getting a lot of attention lately is BlackBerry. In the month of June so far, BlackBerry, the company behind the physical mobile keyboard that is making a comeback, is up nearly 30% to USD 15. The stock is coming off its strongest trading day ever based on trading volume after 528 million shares changed hands on Thursday, as per FactSet data cited by Barron’s, compared to today’s 104 million in volume as of midday today. For context, BlackBerry’s trading volume has only surpassed the 200 million threshold on eight separate occasions since the stock started trading. BlackBerry is trading below its highs of the year, since soaring to nearly USD 29 in January 2021, its highest level in a decade. After seeing what they could do to GameStop and AMC, the WallStreetBets crowd is reaching for the stars with BlackBerry, with visions of the company becoming the next Apple dancing in their heads.

2021-06-04T16:39:27.000Z,"Meme stock mania: How much $1,000 would be worth now if you invested earlier","AMC and other meme stocks have dominated the news this week—and, really, most of the year. A flurry of individual investors, spurred on (in part) by Reddit’s r/WallStreetBets community, has sent share prices soaring in companies that Wall Street had largely forgotten. And plenty of people have seen substantial gains in a short period of time. The meme stock traders are largely of two camps: the day traders who ride the gains, then cash out quickly, and the long-term HODLers, the die-hards who see long-term potential in the stock. There’s all sorts of FOMO from other investors and lots of finger-wagging from fundamentalists who say the numbers can’t sustain these stock prices, but individual investors don’t seem to care much about what those groups have to say. What if, though, you were one of the early investors in three of the biggest meme stocks: [hotlink]GameStop[/hotlink], AMC, and Blackberry? How would your portfolio look today if you had bought and held? Here’s a look at what a $1,000 investment in the past could have been worth in the present. Dec. 20, 2013: GameStop and Blackberry had already been trading for years, but this is the first historical data available for AMC, so it’s as good a starting point as any. Your $1,000 in the theater chain would currently be worth $2,760. The same investment in GameStop would have fetched you $5,230. And a [hotlink]Best Buy[/hotlink] investor would have a portfolio worth $2,100. March 27, 2015: AMC shares were at a high of $34.95 as moviegoers flocked to see Home. Investors who bought then would see that investment now worth $1,610. GameStop was at $38.36 at the time, bringing the return to $6,760. And Blackberry was down to $9.46, and your $1,000 would be worth $1,600 today. Nov. 17, 2017: GameStop shares were well along their slow slide down from their 2015 peaks at this point, a descent that wouldn’t stop until this year. Shares were trading at $16.31. Your $1,000 would now be worth $15,940. Blackberry was on a bit of a rise, hitting $10.30, making the investment worth $1,490 today. And AMC was in a slump, hitting $12.95. An investment then could be cashed in for $4,250 now.     ",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/meme-stock-mania-much-1-163927024.html

Source: TY Lim / Shutterstock.com Reddit has been rallying shares all week long and boosting them higher in massive short squeezes. While some stocks are still on the rise, others appear to have run their course and are starting to fall back to previous levels. Let’s take a look at how some of the most popular Reddit stocks are performing on Friday. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) stock is still on the rise Friday with shares heading more than 2% higher as of this writing. Heavy trading also has some 187 million shares changing hands. For perspective, the stock’s daily average trading volume is about 131 million shares. GameStop (NYSE:GME) stock could be doing better today as shares decrease over 1% from yesterday’s close. The company has seen nearly 2 million shares traded today. That’s well below its daily average trading volume of 14.4 million shares. BlackBerry (NYSE:BB) stock is getting it the worst today with one of Reddit’s favorites falling over 5% as of this writing. That comes alongside heavy trading of the shares with some 104 million having changed hands. That’s more than the daily average trading volume of 28.6 million shares for the stock. While the meme stock rally might not continue, that doesn’t mean there aren’t other short squeeze targets to consider. Vinco Ventures (NASDAQ:BBIG) and Xeris Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:XERS) are both likely candidates for further short squeezes. You can learn more about them at these links.

2021-06-07T17:40:28.000Z,A meme stock’s downward spiral: GameStop’s 14-year Fortune 500 run comes to an endFortune,"Meme stocks are making your 401(k) returns look minuscule. Since the start of 2021, the S&P 500 index has climbed 12.6%—which, if the year ended now, would be an above-average annual return. But that pales in comparison to shares of [hotlink]GameStop[/hotlink] (ticker: GME)—the alpha dog in the meme stock space—which are up a staggering 1,218% during that same span. When members of the r/WallStreetBets subreddit started buying GME and other meme stocks, including companies like BlackBerry (+109%) and AMC (+2,160%), in January, it looked like a classic pump and dump. Or a joke, in their eyes, meant to damage some hedge funds (read: Melvin Capital) while retail investors made a quick buck. For these three stocks, in particular, the dump hasn’t come. But that doesn’t rule out a pullback. Indeed, the prices of many of these meme stocks are completely out of whack with fundamentals. Just how detached are meme stocks from reality? There’s no better example than GameStop. When the 2021 edition of the Fortune 500, a ranking of the 500 largest U.S. publicly traded companies by revenue, was published last week, it did not have GameStop on it. That marked the end of GameStop’s 14-year streak on the list—including a No. 464 placement last year. Falling off the Fortune 500 list is just one of many signs that GameStop’s business model is floundering. Back in the aughts, GameStop stores in shopping malls and strip malls were packed with teenagers looking to buy and trade in games for their Xboxes and GameCubes. But in the early 2010s, that brick-and-mortar model was disrupted by the digitization of the video game industry, as more gamers began downloading new titles rather than buying physical copies. GameStop’s revenue, which peaked at $9.6 billion in 2012, had fallen to $6.5 billion by fiscal year 2020. Then the pandemic took it down another notch. During its 2021 fiscal year, which ran through Jan. 31, GameStop sales totaled $5.1 billion. Since 2012, its sales are down 47%.

2021-06-08T15:59:58.000Z,Wendy's just became the first fast-food meme stock — but there is a catchYahoo Finance,"Beloved burger and Frosty chain Wendy's (WEN) has won the honor of being the first fast-food stock to get roped into the red-hot meme stock trade. Shares of Wendy's spiked 16% in early afternoon trading on Tuesday after a favorable mention by traders on Reddit. The Wendy's ticker page was the second most trafficked on the Yahoo Finance platform, behind other meme crowd favorite Clover Health (whose stock popped 55% out of nowhere). Wendy's stock outperformed the slight decline in meme stock darling AMC Entertainment and a 6% rise in the OG of meme trading, GameStop (which reports earnings on Wednesday).  ""We’re aware of the unusual trading activity this morning and we’re closely monitoring,"" a Wendy's spokesperson told Yahoo Finance.  There are at least two striking things with the out of left field move in Wendy's shares Tuesday.  First, only 4.64% of the company's outstanding shares are sold short, according to Yahoo Finance Plus data. That runs counter to the high short position stocks that have characterized this year's meme stock trade. In other words, Wall Street is in no way betting against the future of Wendy's, dissimilar to GameStop and AMC.  And that brings us to the second point. The reason why Wall Street doesn't hate Wendy's is that unlike other meme stocks, Wendy's is a fundamentally sound business that is growing.  Wendy's U.S. same-store sales in the first quarter surged 13.5%, powered by diners heading back out after getting their COVID-19 vaccine and trying the chain's new breakfast menu. Digital ordering and a push into more premium chicken sandwiches also lit a fire under first quarter sales. Wendy's same-store sales internationally rose 7.9%. The Dave Thomas creation almost beat out McDonald's U.S.'s 13.6% same-store sales increase in the quarter, the latter of which could be seen as a letdown considering it launched three new chicken sandwiches. Same-store sales for Burger King in the U.S. rose 6.6% in the quarter.

Shares of the theater chain rose as much as 10%, adding to Monday’s 15% gain and continuing what’s been a wild ride for investors. Wendy’s jumped as much as 19% to notch a record as the fast-food restaurant operator gained traction on social media, including several touts on Reddit’s WallStreetBets forum. So-called meme stocks broadly gained Monday. Clover Health Investments Corp. also rallied as it was among the most mentioned companies in Stocktwits over the last day. The Chamath Palihapitiya-backed health insurer surged as much as 59%, the most ever, after Monday’s 32% advance. Clover Health short interest as a percentage of float is about 42%, data from financial analytics firm S3 Partners show. “The power of the network effect of social media entices more people to get involved, so then they start broadening their horizons, looking for other names that have high short interest and things like that,” said Michael O’Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading. GameStop Corp., the original icon among retail traders, surged as much as 21% to the highest in almost three months ahead of quarterly earnings results, which are expected Wednesday. MKM Partners analyst Eric Handler said in a note Tuesday that AMC should focus on debt reduction with its newly raised capital rather than acquisitions. He rates the stock sell with a $1 price target. “Management has been gifted an unforeseen opportunity from the recent wave of (fanatical) retail investor momentum, which has pushed the shares far above historical valuation levels,” Handler wrote. AMC company insiders have continued to take advantage of the stock’s run-up in price. Board member Howard Koch Jr. divested more than $790,000 of shares on Monday, according to a filing with the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission. Last week, AMC executives and directors sold $8 million in shares.     ",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amc-wendy-lead-rally-meme-124154704.html

How To Buy Hot Stocks With Less RiskInvestor's Business Daily Video,"Meme stocks like AMC and GameStop are once again getting a lot of attention. Though they can skyrocket in the short term, their volatility is a concern for investors looking for steady outperformance. But for investors who want to ride the wave of what's trending, there's an ETF for that – the recently launched FOMO ETF. Matthew Tuttle, CEO and CIO of Tuttle Capital Management, explains how investors can use the ""fear of missing out"" to their advantage. [MUSIC PLAYING] ALISSA CORAM: Meme stocks like AMC and GameStop are once again getting a lot of attention. And though they can skyrocket in the short term, their volatility is a concern for investors looking for steady outperformance. But for those who want to ride the wave of what's trending, there's an ETF for that, the recently launched FOMO ETF. Joining me now to discuss is Matthew Tuttle. He is CEO and CIO of Tuttle Capital Management. Thanks so much for joining me today, Matthew. MATTHEW TUTTLE: Thank you for having me. ALISSA CORAM: So first of all, FOMO is definitely a catchy phrase out there right now, the fear of missing out. And I think many investors experience that. Sound investing is based on rules. But emotion is also a very big part of investing. So give us your take on how investors can actually use this FOMO to their advantage. MATTHEW TUTTLE: Yeah, so there's so much going on right now in markets, more than we've ever seen. So you've got the meme stocks. You've got the crypto. You've got the value stocks. So what FOMO is designed to do is allow investors to get access to all of those areas. And then going forward, whatever it happens to be the hot area, because it's going to change over time, but to do it in a smarter way. So we're going to have the GameStops. We're going to have the AMCs. We're going to have some of the Bitcoin things and the blockchain things. But we're going got weight those according to downside volatility so we're never going to have a situation where we're in a whole bunch of stuff in large amounts that gets you crushed.

2021-06-04T08:54:30.000Z,Reddit traders put $345m into AMC but meme stock mania has peaked,"The recent revival of investor interest in so-called ""meme stocks"" like US cinema chain AMC (AMC) and retro smartphone maker BlackBerry (BB) may already be over, according to analysis of retail trading flows. Vanda Research said on Friday that its proprietary tools tracking retail investor flows in the US and UK suggested interest in meme stocks ""probably peaked on Wednesday."" AMC's stock close to doubled on Wednesday amid a flurry of interest in the stock from day traders and other amateur investors, many of whom share ideas on the Reddit forum r/WallStreetBets. AMC has become an in vogue stock among this band of investors and this week's price action recalled similar retail price action seen in GameStop's (GME) stock at the start of the year.  Watch: AMC Stock Tanks After Company Files To Sell 11 Million Shares On June 3, AMC Entertainment filed to sell 11.5 million shares of the company's stock Read more: UK investors at risk as Brits pile into meme stock AMC In total, retail investors put $345m (£245m) into AMC over the last five trading days, according to Vanda. That was 328% above the one-month average. AMC's share price surge came as the company announced it was raising new cash and deepening its relationship with retail investors though initiatives including free popcorn. But even AMC was alarmed by its stock movements — the company on Thursday said its share surge appeared to be ""unrelated to our underlying business"" and warned people not to buy its stock ""unless you are prepared to incur the risk of losing all or a substantial portion of your investment."" The warning appears to have worked, with Vanda reporting a major drop-off in retail buying on Thursday. The stock sunk 17% and was down another 9.8% in the pre-market on Friday. ""AMC, by far the stock with the largest retail purchases, received $66m in new inflows, less than half of the $136m it had averaged from Monday to Wednesday,"" said Ben Onatibia, a senior strategist at Vanda.

2021-06-07T17:40:28.000Z,A meme stock’s downward spiral: GameStop’s 14-year Fortune 500 run comes to an endFortune,"Meme stocks are making your 401(k) returns look minuscule. Since the start of 2021, the S&P 500 index has climbed 12.6%—which, if the year ended now, would be an above-average annual return. But that pales in comparison to shares of [hotlink]GameStop[/hotlink] (ticker: GME)—the alpha dog in the meme stock space—which are up a staggering 1,218% during that same span. When members of the r/WallStreetBets subreddit started buying GME and other meme stocks, including companies like BlackBerry (+109%) and AMC (+2,160%), in January, it looked like a classic pump and dump. Or a joke, in their eyes, meant to damage some hedge funds (read: Melvin Capital) while retail investors made a quick buck. For these three stocks, in particular, the dump hasn’t come. But that doesn’t rule out a pullback. Indeed, the prices of many of these meme stocks are completely out of whack with fundamentals. Just how detached are meme stocks from reality? There’s no better example than GameStop. When the 2021 edition of the Fortune 500, a ranking of the 500 largest U.S. publicly traded companies by revenue, was published last week, it did not have GameStop on it. That marked the end of GameStop’s 14-year streak on the list—including a No. 464 placement last year. Falling off the Fortune 500 list is just one of many signs that GameStop’s business model is floundering. Back in the aughts, GameStop stores in shopping malls and strip malls were packed with teenagers looking to buy and trade in games for their Xboxes and GameCubes. But in the early 2010s, that brick-and-mortar model was disrupted by the digitization of the video game industry, as more gamers began downloading new titles rather than buying physical copies. GameStop’s revenue, which peaked at $9.6 billion in 2012, had fallen to $6.5 billion by fiscal year 2020. Then the pandemic took it down another notch. During its 2021 fiscal year, which ran through Jan. 31, GameStop sales totaled $5.1 billion. Since 2012, its sales are down 47%.

2021-06-08T10:36:25.000Z,Clover Health soars as 'meme stock' rally expandsReuters,"(Reuters) -Shares of Clover Health Investments Corp surged as much as 109% on Tuesday as it became a new focus for small individual traders on social media platforms who have prompted rallies in heavily shorted U.S. stocks this year. Medicare-backed insurance seller Clover was among the most shorted stocks across U.S. exchanges, with Clover being the target of a report by short seller Hindenburg in February, which took a position in the company. ""The WallStreetBets forum (on Reddit) has identified (stocks with) over 30% short interests,"" said Thomas Hayes, managing member at Great Hill Capital Llc in New York. The ""meme stock"" phenomenon, which began with video game retailer GameStop Corp in January and spread to cinema operator AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc in May, has prompted the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to say it was looking into signs of market manipulation. Short interest in Clover Health is at 49.10 million shares, or 43.5% of the float, Ihor Dusaniwsky, managing director of predictive analytics at S3 said on Tuesday. Short sellers were down $465 million in mark-to-market losses on Tuesday, based on a more than 80% price gain, which raised year-to-date losses to $517 million, he said. Shorts have been building their position in Clover Health as its stock price has been rallying, Dusaniwsky said. Clover's backer, venture capitalist Chamath Palihapitiya, took the company public through a $3.7 billion reverse merger with his blank check firm in October 2020. Clover's shares were up 81.6% at $21.64 after earlier hitting a record high of $24.93. The company's options have drawn a surge of bullish action in recent days with trading volume surging to 587,000 contracts on Monday, compared with an average daily volume of under 50,000 contracts for the month of May, Trade Alert data showed.

The stocks are off their highs of the day, and retail investors are convinced that something shady is going on. Short sellers are swinging back after losing USD 2.2 billion from AMC’s rally last week. There are theories of traders pulling out all the stops — including the illegal practice of naked shorting, which is currently trending on Twitter. Shares of AMC have galloped 16% today but still failed to cross the psychologically important USD 60 level, where the movie chain stock closed above on June 2 for the first time. While AMC might be off its peak, investors don’t have much to clamor about considering that the stock has skyrocketed more than 467% since early May. Fellow WallStreetBets stock GameStop is tacking on close to 11% in today’s session. The stock has gained more than 1,400% year-to-date for a market cap of USD 19.4 billion. GameStop investors have proven to be a loyal bunch as it hasn’t always been easy to hold. But those who have stuck around continue to be rewarded with more potential runway for gains. Ihor Dusaniwsky, managing director of predictive analytics at S3 Partners, revealed in a tweet that GMC and AMC each have a short squeeze risk score attached of 10 out of a possible 10. Meanwhile, the WallStreetBets crowd has taken over Twitter, with #nakedshorting trending on the social media site. To be clear, unlike regular shorting, which is legal, naked selling is not legal. It has to do with selling shares that have not been issued yet. Nonetheless, it still happens in the market. Naked shorting is how 140% of GameStop’s float can have short interest, as pointed out by Charles Payne on Fox Business. Christian, Smith & Jewell Law Firm Attorney Wes Christian said he blames the prime brokers that are custodying the assets as well as market makers for this behavior.

2021-06-08T05:35:16.000Z,Meme Stocks Set To Extend Gains TuesdayInvesting.com,"By Dhirendra Tripathi Investing.com — Meme stocks, led by AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC), looked set to extend their gains for the second consecutive session rising 2%-5% in premarket Tuesday. The favorite of the Reddit gang, AMC, was up more than 4% while GameStop (NYSE:GME) and BlackBerry (NYSE:BB) gained approximately 2% and 3%, respectively. Meme stocks have defied the naysayers consistently over the last six months and while GameStop and Blackberry (TSX:BB) may be significantly off their year’s highs, it’s not been a flash in the pan. In the process, the stocks have made new highs several times and created wealth for many even as their books may not yet deserve those valuations. The companies are trying though. To the surprise of many, AMC has raised $1.24 billion in equity in three installments in less than a month, each at a different price, and proposes to sell 25 million more shares in 2022. GameStop, once a bankruptcy candidate, has reshuffled its top management as it tries to become a multichannel global retailer, retired part of its debt and created new facilities. Blackberry continues to strengthen its security software portfolio, have more cloud-based offerings and forge new partnerships.

2021-06-03T17:57:04.000Z,This is no longer our grandparents' or parents' stock market: strategist,"Love it or hate it, the Meme Market is back, and Wall Street strategists say it can’t be ignored. While shares of AMC Entertainment (AMC) are having a volatile Thursday, the social-media-fueled trading frenzy has pushed shares of AMC up nearly 3,000% this year, giving the money-losing movie theater chain a market value of more than $30 billion. AMC is not alone. Shares of Bed, Bath & Beyond (BBBY), Express (EXPR), and BlackBerry (BB) are all up this year. It’s reminiscent of the eye-popping run-up in shares of Gamestop (GME) that we saw back in January, when the Reddit investing crowd bought shares of the struggling video game retailer to stick it to the Wall Street pros who were betting against the stock. Ryan Nauman, market strategist at Zephyr told Yahoo Finance Live that wild trading in these so-called meme stocks is not so much a “threat” to the broader market as it is a “learning experience.” “This is no longer our grandparents’, or for that matter, our parents' stock market,” Nauman said. “Now, investment professionals need to start focusing more on looking at alternative data sets, rethinking their investment thesis to consider this growing cohort of retail investors.” Even if you’ve vowed to stay away from the “meme trading madness,” you may own AMC and GameStop and not even know it, because the stocks are still part of the Vanguard Russell 2000 Value Index Fund ETF Shares (VTWV). The recent rallies in those two stocks have pushed the Russell 2000 Value Index up 30% year-to-date, dusting the Vanguard Russell 2000 Growth Index Fund ETF Shares' (VTWG) 3.8% gain during the same period. “These retail investors, because of day trading, and for the most part, because of this virtually free money that we've had from the Fed since the pandemic, their voice is getting much larger due to social media,” Nauman said. “They need to be considered when we are coming up with the investment thesis moving forward.”         ",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/this-is-no-longer-our-grandparents-or-parents-stock-market-strategist-175704670.html

Rhea Thomas, Wilmington Trust senior economist, and Jon Adams, BMO Global Asset Management senior investment strategist joined Yahoo Finance Live to discuss. [MUSIC PLAYING] SEANA SMITH: Got just around a minute and a half here until the closing bell. We have full coverage for you this afternoon. We have Rhea Thomas of Wilmington Trust, a senior economist there. We also Jon Adams, BMO's Global Asset Management Senior Investment Strategist.

The Dow trending just along, now it's off 123 points, so bouncing back a little bit, just off its lows of the day. The S&P off just by a fraction here. It could still turn positive in the final minute of trading. NASDAQ on the other hand, holding onto gains. It has been the outperformer for the entire trading day. And now up just around a half of a percent. Taking a look at some of the individual movers in the markets today, looking over at the Dow, the worst performers in the Dow, Caterpillar, that stock off just around 2%. Merck and Dow Inc. are also among the biggest laggards there. UnitedHealth and Travelers rounding out the five worst performers in the Dow today. Taking a look at the sector action here, worst performer is materials. The XLB off just over 1%. We're also seeing some under-performers in financials and industrials. Flipping over though to what's outperforming, why we aren't seeing broader losses here today, real estate is the biggest outperformer today, with that sector up just around 1%. [BELL RINGING] Communication services and health care also holding on to gains. ADAM SHAPIRO: And there is the closing bell. When we get the gavel, we're going to see where these markets settle. As you heard Seana say, it appears that the Dow was pulling off of the session lows. But where it settles is going to be in the red. Right now, the Dow looks like it will settle around down 127 points. The S&P 500 off by about three points, NASDAQ will be up about 67 points.

2021-06-08T16:56:11.000Z,Don't expect a 'hot vax summer' for stocks: strategistYahoo Finance,"Stocks are grinding higher, with the S&P 500 (^GSPC) approaching record highs and the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) at the highest level in one month. But one Wall Street strategist is warning investors that the ""hot vax summer"" for stocks ""might feel a little cold and rocky."" Callie Cox, senior investment strategist at Ally Invest, explained on Yahoo Finance Live that the summer is a historically weak period for stocks. Volume typically trails off as investors leave the office and hit the roads.  ""[W]e could see lower volume in the stock market. And lower volume typically leads to a wandering market, especially with the environment we're in, where investors are kind of looking around the corner and saying, 'what's next? What's the ominous thing on the outlook?' And they're feeling a little more hesitant about putting their money in stocks,"" she said. This doesn't preclude market strength or necessarily mean we'll see weakness this summer. Cox pointed out that since 1990, the S&P 500 has risen an average of 0.9% between Memorial Day and Labor Day. But that compares to an average of 3.6% for the months before Memorial Day and 4.2% for the months after Labor Day. ""Stocks have bucked the trend recently, though, with five straight summers of gains (including the S&P 500’s 16% gains last summer). And the market’s path of least resistance is higher,"" she said.  Earlier this year, Cox told Yahoo Finance that year two of a new bull market typically sees more muted returns than those of the first year, which tend to be higher. Despite the general market strength, investors should still exercise caution. In a separate statement to Yahoo Finance, she writes, ""In a (relatively) low-volume environment, bad news tends to hit a hit harder, and small shifts in buying or selling could lead to noticeable market swings. Investors are extra skittish these days, too. We can tell the market’s mindset has changed from 'What could go right?' to 'What could go wrong?,' and that’s led to quick selling on surprise headlines.""

While AMC might be off its peak, investors don’t have much to clamor about considering that the stock has skyrocketed more than 467% since early May. Fellow WallStreetBets stock GameStop is tacking on close to 11% in today’s session. The stock has gained more than 1,400% year-to-date for a market cap of USD 19.4 billion. GameStop investors have proven to be a loyal bunch as it hasn’t always been easy to hold. But those who have stuck around continue to be rewarded with more potential runway for gains. Ihor Dusaniwsky, managing director of predictive analytics at S3 Partners, revealed in a tweet that GMC and AMC each have a short squeeze risk score attached of 10 out of a possible 10. Meanwhile, the WallStreetBets crowd has taken over Twitter, with #nakedshorting trending on the social media site. To be clear, unlike regular shorting, which is legal, naked selling is not legal. It has to do with selling shares that have not been issued yet. Nonetheless, it still happens in the market. Naked shorting is how 140% of GameStop’s float can have short interest, as pointed out by Charles Payne on Fox Business. Christian, Smith & Jewell Law Firm Attorney Wes Christian said he blames the prime brokers that are custodying the assets as well as market makers for this behavior.

2021-06-08T05:35:16.000Z,Meme Stocks Set To Extend Gains TuesdayInvesting.com,"By Dhirendra Tripathi Investing.com — Meme stocks, led by AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC), looked set to extend their gains for the second consecutive session rising 2%-5% in premarket Tuesday. The favorite of the Reddit gang, AMC, was up more than 4% while GameStop (NYSE:GME) and BlackBerry (NYSE:BB) gained approximately 2% and 3%, respectively. Meme stocks have defied the naysayers consistently over the last six months and while GameStop and Blackberry (TSX:BB) may be significantly off their year’s highs, it’s not been a flash in the pan. In the process, the stocks have made new highs several times and created wealth for many even as their books may not yet deserve those valuations. The companies are trying though. To the surprise of many, AMC has raised $1.24 billion in equity in three installments in less than a month, each at a different price, and proposes to sell 25 million more shares in 2022. GameStop, once a bankruptcy candidate, has reshuffled its top management as it tries to become a multichannel global retailer, retired part of its debt and created new facilities. Blackberry continues to strengthen its security software portfolio, have more cloud-based offerings and forge new partnerships.

2021-06-03T17:25:03.000Z,Bed Bath & Beyond CEO Mark Tritton isn't getting sucked into meme stock mania,"This journalist remembers chatting on a number of occasions with Mark Tritton when he was the whiz kid behind Target's merchandising revival from 2016 to 2019.  Tritton — serving as Target's chief merchandising officer — was level-headed, decisive, creatively-focused and believed he could bring the cheap chic cool factor back to the discount retailer. He achieved his mission (Tritton remains a big reason why it's fun to shop at Target), and Target's bottom line continues to benefit from it to this day.  So I haven't been surprised to see Tritton run that same operational playbook since arriving as Bed Bath & Beyond's CEO (his first CEO job) in late 2019 to essentially save the home goods retailer from ruin.  Tritton quickly canned most of the terrible, long-tenured, under performing management team. He wasted no time to sell off non-core assets to raise a boatload of cash to fund a turnaround. He laid out long-term financial targets to Wall Street, and is delivering on them in a very volatile retail backdrop. Meanwhile, he is aggressively remodeling stores and totally overhauling the merchandise in them in a bid to regain customer loyalty.  Over time, Bed Bath & Beyond shareholders will likely be rewarded for these careful, well thought out efforts. Up to this point they have been: Bed Bath's stock has surged 155% since Tritton was named CEO on October 9, 2019. Worth noting, shares of Tritton's former employer Target are up 104% over that timespan.  Having said all of that, it's really no surprise I found Tritton keeping things in perspective at about 12:30 p.m. on June 2, 2021 in an interview on Yahoo Finance Live. Tritton stepped to the mic (remotely, still) as his stock price was up more than 40%, swept up once again into the meme stock mania being churned up by an army of retail traders.  ""I think today's activities are just a day in time. It doesn't affect us operationally. We are focused and ready,"" Tritton said. ""Regardless of the stock movement our role is to create sequential growth and strength at both the balance sheet and in growth ratios. We believe we have been doing that.""

Since the start of 2021, the S&P 500 index has climbed 12.6%—which, if the year ended now, would be an above-average annual return. But that pales in comparison to shares of [hotlink]GameStop[/hotlink] (ticker: GME)—the alpha dog in the meme stock space—which are up a staggering 1,218% during that same span. When members of the r/WallStreetBets subreddit started buying GME and other meme stocks, including companies like BlackBerry (+109%) and AMC (+2,160%), in January, it looked like a classic pump and dump. Or a joke, in their eyes, meant to damage some hedge funds (read: Melvin Capital) while retail investors made a quick buck. For these three stocks, in particular, the dump hasn’t come. But that doesn’t rule out a pullback. Indeed, the prices of many of these meme stocks are completely out of whack with fundamentals. Just how detached are meme stocks from reality? There’s no better example than GameStop. When the 2021 edition of the Fortune 500, a ranking of the 500 largest U.S. publicly traded companies by revenue, was published last week, it did not have GameStop on it. That marked the end of GameStop’s 14-year streak on the list—including a No. 464 placement last year. Falling off the Fortune 500 list is just one of many signs that GameStop’s business model is floundering. Back in the aughts, GameStop stores in shopping malls and strip malls were packed with teenagers looking to buy and trade in games for their Xboxes and GameCubes. But in the early 2010s, that brick-and-mortar model was disrupted by the digitization of the video game industry, as more gamers began downloading new titles rather than buying physical copies. GameStop’s revenue, which peaked at $9.6 billion in 2012, had fallen to $6.5 billion by fiscal year 2020. Then the pandemic took it down another notch. During its 2021 fiscal year, which ran through Jan. 31, GameStop sales totaled $5.1 billion. Since 2012, its sales are down 47%.

The stock -- like GameStop Corp. before it -- has become a darling of retail traders. The movie-theater chain’s wild rise comes despite questionable fundamentals, prompting concerns among regulators that investors could be sitting on substantial losses if the stock plunges. The SEC has already said it’s investigating what happened with GameStop in January, with a focus on whether traders were using online message boards to dupe other investors into buying into the rally.

ALEXIS CHRISTOFOROUS: Want to continue on with the markets now and bring in Brian Jacobsen. He is Multi Asset Strategist at Wells Fargo Asset Management. Brian, always good to see you. I want to stick with this meme theme here for a moment. Yesterday, we had a market strategist from Zephyr on who said, you know, like it or not, these retail investors who are sending some of these stocks into the stratosphere cannot and should not be ignored. What's your take on that? BRIAN JACOBSEN: Well, yeah, on my team, we agree. I mean, monitoring liquidity in markets, and seeing if there is excessive shorting of stocks, and seeing if there's going to be some sort of short squeeze-- to me, that's just sort of basics when it comes to portfolio management and trying to decide when it is that you're going to enter or exit a position. A lot of the portfolio managers that we work with, especially in the small cap space, were talking about how it is that over the last few months, because of the meme trade, that they've actually been able to take profits and exit some positions with some decent gains for our shareholders. And so they are a force to be reckoned with. But also keep in mind that what the swarm gives, they can also take, as you see with some of the volatility here. And so sometimes if the price moves and it's not an informational move, it might actually be prudent to take some profits on that. KRISTIN MYERS: So, then, it sounds like, Brian, you're saying that despite the fact that so many people are saying that, frankly, this is gambling, it's just out and out speculation, that there is money that you would be leaving on the table if you don't get involved in some of these trades with AME-- or AMC, excuse me, or GameStop, or Bed Bath and Beyond, or some of the others?

ALEXIS CHRISTOFOROUS: I want to continue our discussion on the markets now and bring in Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National. Art, good to see you. I want to stick with these meme stocks and the fact that a lot of investors might not even know they own these stocks because they're part of the Russell 2000 Small Cap Value Index. I'm talking about AMC and GameStop among them. What do regular investors who don't want to play the meme game need to know about what's going on in that space right now? ART HOGAN: Yeah, it's such a great question, Alexis. And I think that-- I think you and Jared hit it right in the last section, where he said it's its own animal. And you said it's a frenzy, right? So understand that that's what's going on right now. It's a separate sideshow. It is its own animal. It is a frenzy. It's a mania. But if you are along the Russell 2000, the IWM, part of the movement you've seen in the Russell 2000 has been because of companies like AMC and GameStop. And that will continue to be the case until they reconstitute that index. And actually, these names are going to get kicked out because they're too large. This is the function of if they're going to be put into the Russell 1,000, right? So that's what happens once a year, where it just so happens that that's happening this month. But in the near term, understand that if there's a handful of meme stocks that are rotating in and out of favor, it could have a potential move on the Russell 2000. But understand very small, the percentage that AMC or GameStop, back in the day when GameStop was the only game in town. In meme land, I think that that had a bit of a move on the Russell, too. But I think the Russell, too, really has been driven. Because it's domestically focused, focused on the US economy. Small cap tend to be cyclical. There's a lot of energy and financials in there. So I think there's a lot more fundamental drivers for the Russell 2000 right now versus that poll that has been the meme stock frenzy.

Rhea Thomas, Wilmington Trust senior economist, and Jon Adams, BMO Global Asset Management senior investment strategist joined Yahoo Finance Live to discuss. [MUSIC PLAYING] SEANA SMITH: Got just around a minute and a half here until the closing bell. We have full coverage for you this afternoon. We have Rhea Thomas of Wilmington Trust, a senior economist there. We also Jon Adams, BMO's Global Asset Management Senior Investment Strategist. And let's take a look at where things stand here with just around a minute to go until the closing bell. We haven't seen a heck of a lot of movement in the final couple hours of trading. The Dow trending just along, now it's off 123 points, so bouncing back a little bit, just off its lows of the day. The S&P off just by a fraction here. It could still turn positive in the final minute of trading. NASDAQ on the other hand, holding onto gains. It has been the outperformer for the entire trading day. And now up just around a half of a percent. Taking a look at some of the individual movers in the markets today, looking over at the Dow, the worst performers in the Dow, Caterpillar, that stock off just around 2%. Merck and Dow Inc. are also among the biggest laggards there. UnitedHealth and Travelers rounding out the five worst performers in the Dow today. Taking a look at the sector action here, worst performer is materials. The XLB off just over 1%. We're also seeing some under-performers in financials and industrials. Flipping over though to what's outperforming, why we aren't seeing broader losses here today, real estate is the biggest outperformer today, with that sector up just around 1%. [BELL RINGING] Communication services and health care also holding on to gains. ADAM SHAPIRO: And there is the closing bell. When we get the gavel, we're going to see where these markets settle. As you heard Seana say, it appears that the Dow was pulling off of the session lows. But where it settles is going to be in the red. Right now, the Dow looks like it will settle around down 127 points. The S&P 500 off by about three points, NASDAQ will be up about 67 points.

[MUSIC PLAYING] ALISSA CORAM: Now, Scott, I know you also like not only just looking at what are the top groups but how big of a move maybe you're seeing for a certain industry group. If it goes from 180 to 100, that sort of puts it on your radar. Can you talk a little bit about that part of your industry group analysis? - Yeah. So I'm not as good at Excel as Justin is. So I think he does the same thing. But he just lets Excel do the work. I just let my eyes do the work. So I eyeball it. So if you pull up the industry groups. And I always pull and cover the whole chart so that I can see them. And then if I have it sorted based on industry group rank currently, which I think you do-- correct. So I'm going to start my eye on the column that says IND group rank three months. In other words, what was the group three months ago? And then I'm just going to look across. I'm looking for, exactly, a big change, like retail leisure products, 99, three, four. What I'd prefer is 100, 70, 30, right? Something that's moving in that direction. The one that jumped out to me this week-- and the thing is, you do this each week. And there'll only be a couple of groups that jump out at you that do this. And then a lot of times, you'll be like, oh, well, I already looked at that group. I know what I'm going to buy in that group or I know there's nothing to buy. But the one that jumped out at me was medical hospitals. I think right now, it's 97, 14, 18. It's already updated. I think this weekend. It was 99, 20, 14 or something. It had that kind of trend. And then, like what Justin said, I can see there are nine stocks. It's not that deep a group. The one above it, you'll see retail wholesale is one, right? So if I see one, it's just like, OK, that's not that important. So I would like the group to be a little deeper. But let's just use this as an example. I would double click medical hospitals. It'll pull up the chart for you. And then on the right-hand side in the related information panel, you just open that up and just choose stocks and group, exactly that.

2021-06-03T15:32:34.000Z,Why BlackBerry Stock Tanked After Testing The $20 Level,"BlackBerry Video 03.06.21. Shares of BlackBerry tested the $20 level during today’s trading session after a strong upside move on Wednesday as the trade in “meme stocks” continued but lost momentum and pulled back below the $15 level. Traditional leaders of the “meme stock” movement, GameStop and AMC, were moving lower today as traders took profits after the recent rally which was especially strong in AMC’s case. At the same time, it looks that traders are moving funds into other stocks with high short interest like GTT Communications. It remains to be seen whether this recent trend will be sustainable, but it is clear that traders should stay away from shorting highly-shorted names as other retail traders are constantly searching for the “new GameStop”. AMC has recently issued an 8-K filing in which it warned investors that they could lose “all or a substantial portion” of their investments. AMC also noted that recent valuation levels were significantly higher than the levels seen immediately prior to the pandemic, and that current valuation levels reflected trading dynamics that were unrelated to the company’s financial performance or prospects. This warning put pressure on AMC shares and also triggered selling in some of the recent high-flyers, including BlackBerry stock. Analysts expect that BlackBerry will report a loss of $0.05 per share in the current year and turn to a profit of $0.06 per share in the next year. In this light, the stock is trading at 242 forward P/E (the stock price at the time of writing is $14.50) which means that BlackBerry shares remain far away from reasonable valuation levels. If the current sell-off in “meme stocks” continues, BlackBerry stock can easily return to recent levels below $10 as it remains grossly overvalued near the $15 level.

MYLES UDLAND: OK, joining us now to talk about the state of the markets and how retail has been playing this market is JJ Kinahan. He's the Chief Market Strategist over at TD Ameritrade. So JJ, right before you came on, you heard us talking about what's happening with the meme names. You guys have your latest survey out of what your investors have moved in and out of the most. And a name that I did not see on that list was AMC. What have you seen on your side in some of these big names that really constitute kind of the core of the meme trade? JJ KINAHAN: Sure. So you know, if you think about it, AMC, GameStop, et cetera, for the last month wasn't necessarily as big a story. It became a bigger story right at the end of the month. What was interesting to me is when I looked at those stocks is that the week before Memorial-- so Memorial Day was a week ago today, it was last week on Tuesday that we really saw these explode. The week before, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday is when we actually saw our clients start to buy those names more. On Tuesday and Wednesday, our clients were more even in terms of their buying and selling of the stocks. So I thought that that part was really, really interesting overall. Obviously, the interest increased pretty significantly. Actually the one name that you didn't talk about but I know is part of the picture-- and just, you guys, it was a great discussion, had a lot to cover there-- was BlackBerry. BlackBerry was a name that in terms of percentage-wise, the volume picked up very significantly. Because GameStop and AMC continue to have this sort of interest all the time. And I thought it was interesting, you know, Julia was comparing some of this when we go down and people come in and buy it, to Tesla. And you know, and the stocks our clients purchased last month, Tesla was one of them, because they did sell off. And I think there was a little bit of a difference-- and it's one of the things you guys were talking about-- and that I also believe in talking to our clients that there's a belief that AMC is also a reopening play as much as a meme stock play, because people think that there is a hunger for movies and good movies, and people like the theater experience.

Meanwhile, more than 63% of all new trades executed by UK traders on Capital.com in the past two weeks have been in financial derivatives linked to shares in AMC.  This is a significant jump from just 23% last month. Capital added that more than 82% of UK clients this week took a long position in the so-called meme stock. AMC was also the most purchased share on Hargreaves Lansdown, the biggest retail investment platform in the UK, over the past week with GameStop (GME) following closely behind.  It comes as AMC warned investors on Thursday not to ""buy our stock right now"", sending the price down as much as 30% before it pared back some losses. In a filing it said: ""We believe that the recent volatility and our current market prices reflect market and trading dynamics unrelated to our underlying business, or macro or industry fundamentals, and we do not know how long these dynamics will last. ""Under the circumstances, we caution you against investing in our Class A common stock, unless you are prepared to incur the risk of losing all or a substantial portion of your investment.""

2021-06-07T14:20:37.000Z,"AMC, other 'meme' stocks jump; regulator signals concernReuters","By Aaron Saldanha, Sinéad Carew and David Randall (Reuters) -Shares of AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc and other ""meme stocks"" jumped on Monday, extending a rally in social-media favorites into a third week as message boards hummed with talk of squeezing Wall Street short-sellers. The sharp gains prompted the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to say it was looking into signs of market manipulation given the ""volatility in certain stocks."" The volatility has challenged analysts, and two of them in the past week have stopped covering video game retailer GameStop, whose shares soared in January in a retail-driven rally. Cinema operator AMC jumped almost 15%, putting its gain over the past five sessions at 111%. BlackBerry's U.S. listing surged 14% and is now up 57% since the start of June. ""AMC never ceases to amaze me. Just when I think that train is over, it jumps almost 10 points in the first 30 min of trading,"" one poster on Reddit wrote. AMC shares are up about 2,500% in 2021 as the company has courted individual investors, while GameStop has surged over 1,300% year to date. Some bearish investors retreated from bets against AMC on Friday. Short interest slumped to 74.5 million shares, or 14.9% of AMC's float, from 88.2 million on Thursday, according to S3 Partners. Clover Health Investments, which has been the target of short sellers, was one of the most mentioned stocks on Reddit's wallstreetbets on Monday, with some users suggesting the shares as the forum's next short-squeeze target. The insurer's shares soared 32% in their highest volume trading day since April 19. Institutional investors are largely sitting on the sidelines as the meme-stock rally continues. Amateur investors, however, ""don't need a reason,"" said Michael O'Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading in Stamford, Connecticut. ""They're trying to do the same thing they did last week.

MYLES UDLAND: But let's begin our coverage this morning of the market with the story that remains the story. See it there? I love that animation. Meme madness in the market here. AMC, GameStop, of course really the two leading-- we'll call them the leading members of this act, this play, leading cast members of this performance we see happening in the market. But this morning, really, the chaos continues to spread. Wendy's the latest name to get involved. There's now a fast food angle to the stay-at-home trade. If we go all the way back in time to February of 2020, when Wallstreetbets first really became a driving force of conversation around the stock market-- so this was just on the eve of when the market's concern turned to full COVID all the time. We had a big ""Bloomberg Businessweek"" story about getting tendies and about buying call options. YOLO call options really were birthed with that story. Luke Kawa over at Bloomberg writing that. Luke, unfortunately, has since moved on to the dark side, asset management. But we have seen with Wendy's this morning, guys, literal tendies. Their nuggets are excellent, the spicy nuggets, of course. Don't get the regular ones. That's all in the market. And at this point, I mean, where do we begin? Sozzi, let's start with you because you actually cover Wendy's as a fundamental story. Do you have any updates for us there? Anything that we can point to on this? Or is it just the latest ticker to get Redditized here in this market? BRIAN SOZZI: Well, first off, yes, that is in fact correct. Wendy's got, what they say, touted on the Reddit stream early this morning. Also had my former boss Jim Cramer out there, doing his thing, touting Wendy's as well. But I hate to be the bearer of bad news here. But to the meme traders, there's actually a fundamental story to Wendy's. And they're coming off a pretty good first quarter a couple of weeks ago. I talked to CEO Todd Penegor. He tells me they are looking to go from 8,000 restaurants by 2025 from about 7,000 now, a billion-dollar-plus breakfast business probably over the next year.

2021-06-07T09:30:56.000Z,How AMC is differentAxios,"AMC has learned its lesson from the meme winter, and is determined to use the meme summer to its advantage. That's the lesson from last week's wild action in AMC stock, much of which was orchestrated by the company itself. Why it matters: There's a case to be made that AMC only managed to avoid bankruptcy by getting caught up in the meme-stock craze of January, when its share price first became divorced from fundamentals. Get market news worthy of your time with Axios Markets. Subscribe for free. The company might not be able to make money by selling movie tickets, but it's proving itself a master of bringing in money by selling share certificates. How it works: AMC has steadily issued new stock, most recently on Thursday, when it sold more than 11 million shares in less than three hours, netting $587.4 million — more than the entire company's equity value at the beginning of the year. By the numbers: The total number of AMC Class A shares outstanding has risen tenfold from 50 million this time last year, to 500 million today. As a result, the company's market capitalization has risen even faster than its stratospheric share price. The big picture: When GameStop first started heading to the moon, the overwhelming consensus was that the stock had become a pure gambling vehicle that was inevitably going to crash, creating massive losses for people who bought into the hype. Those losses didn't happen: GameStop stock continues to trade at extremely elevated levels, raising the prospect that meme stocks can actually be (very risky) investments, rather than just short-term trades. Once meme stocks become a potential investment, companies can take advantage of that fact by issuing new shares on the capital market — just as other risky companies like Tesla have done in the past. The difference between Tesla and AMC is that AMC isn't a technology stock with the potential to dominate the world. It's just a chain of movie theaters, struggling in the face of a long-term secular decline in Americans' desire to see any but the very biggest movies outside the home.

BlackBerry shares last traded at $18.00 with 214,883,715 shares already changing hands an hour into the trading session compared with its 25-day moving average of 30.5 million. Trading volume in the stock started to spike higher on May 26 with volume vaulting to 26.5 million shares that day. On Wednesday, it closed up 31% with 346 million shares changing hands, its busiest trading day since January 27. Even before Thursday's gains, BlackBerry stock had risen more than 77% in the last five sessions. It is up 174% year-to-date, which would be its biggest annual increase since 2003 if it holds.

In the same SEC filing, the movie chain also cautioned “against investing” in its common stock, unless investors “are prepared to incur the risk of losing all or a substantial portion” of their investment. JULIE HYMAN: But first, we got to talk about AMC, don't we? The company out with a surprise filing this morning, saying it's going to be selling 11 and 1/2 million additional shares, registering to sell them. But what really stood out to us, of course, from this filing was the language within it, and this quote in particular. ""Under the circumstances,"" reads the filing, ""we caution you against investing in our class A common stock, unless you're prepared to incur the risk of losing all or a substantial portion of your investment."" Now, it's not unusual to see sort of caveats, legalese in these types of filings. But even by those standards, this is fairly extraordinary. Here's a bunch more shares to buy. But you might not want to actually do that-- is an interesting move to take. Again, legally, I understand why they have to say it. But it's still pretty stark, Myles, when they actually do. MYLES UDLAND: Yeah. And you know, in addition to that-- and I would encourage viewers who are interested-- and I'm sure many already have-- I would encourage them to go read the rest of the filing. Because there are one, two, three, four, five additional bullet points of caveats on crazy things that have happened with shares of AMC and that may or may not happen to shares of AMC in the future. But again, I think it's quite a shrewd move here on the part of management to come to market for the second time in a week when you have this kind of action in your shares. And you know, I just put a post up on Yahoo Finance that a lot of the AMC bulls think is wrong. They're telling me to read the filing. I tell you to read the filing. The filing says there are 11 and 1/2 million new shares that can be issued. It is under the April prospectus, which has thus been amended today to include the additional shares. The 43 million shares they filed to sell in April, that sale was completed in May at, I believe, $9.94 per share or something like that.

In the case of AMC, the hottest of them for now, traders may be trying to gauge where the company is headed. After raising $1.24 billion in equity in three installments in less than a month, each at a different price, it filed a preliminary proxy on Thursday seeking permission to sell 25 million more shares in 2022. It has been a roller-coaster for AMC traders who saw their stock double in just one session on Wednesday to hit a high of $83.63, only to fall in double digits on announcement of a new equity raise. The shares closed at $66.80 Friday. The pandemic has caused AMC's long-term debt levels to soar to $5.4 billion as of the first three months of this year from less than $2 billion in 2016. And it’s still losing money, with analysts expecting another $100 million to go over the next 12 months.

The Dow posted a slight loss after five sessions of gains. Stocks rebounded somewhat after reports that President Joe Biden offered to scrap his proposed tax hike. In talks with Republicans, the Democrat offered to drop plans to hike corporate rates as high as 28%, and instead set a 15% minimum tax rate for companies, sources told Reuters. A better-than-expected U.S. weekly unemployment report and private payrolls numbers for May pointed to strengthening labor conditions, ahead of the closely watched U.S. payrolls report due on Friday. A measure of service sector activity increased to a record high. Investors are focused on whether robust economic reports could prompt the Fed to pare back monetary support put in place during the coronavirus pandemic sooner than expected. ""The market is digesting strong economic data with some inflationary pressures and factoring in whether this will change the timing of Fed tapering and how to factor that into stock prices,"" said Brad Neuman, director of market strategy at Alger in New York. Sparking fears over easing support was the Fed's announcement on Wednesday that it will begin to unwind its corporate bond holdings acquired last year through an emergency lending facility launched to calm credit markets at the height of the pandemic. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 23.34 points, or 0.07%, to 34,577.04; the S&P 500 lost 15.27 points, or 0.36%, at 4,192.85; and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 141.82 points, or 1.03%, to 13,614.51. The heavyweight S&P 500 tech sector fell 0.9%.

2021-06-03T12:15:27.000Z,AMC just dropped the hammer on every meme stock CEO,"The Meme Market is back with a vengeance.  And AMC (AMC) is playing a different game the second time around.  On Thursday morning, the company filed to sell up to an additional 11.5 million shares as its stock price continues a monster run higher.  On Wednesday alone AMC shares rose 95% and in pre-market trading on Thursday the stock was at one point up another 20%.  But this does not mark the company's first effort to capitalize on recent volatility.  Earlier this week AMC raised $230 million from Mudrick Capital in an offering the company said ""will allow us to be aggressive in going after the most valuable theatre assets, as well as to make other strategic investments in our business and to pursue deleveraging opportunities.""  On Wednesday, the company announced a new shareholder platform that will offer investors perks at actual movie theaters, including free popcorn. As we wrote in Thursday's Morning Brief, a company's stock is its currency and AMC is currently using a sharp rise in the value of this currency to improve its actual business.  And with all these moves, AMC CEO Adam Aron and the whole executive team at the company are putting the pressure on their peers running other companies caught up in the meme trade to not just let this market moment come and go. These are episodes that management teams must cash in on.  Back in the winter when GameStop (GME) was the focal point of the first meme stock rally that management team sat on its hands for months. And now GameStop is in the process of looking for a new CEO.  And while the rally in AMC and other meme names right now might not make sense, from the vantage point of a management team that tries to create value for shareholders the way to respond to this interest is clear: you sell stock until the market can't take it anymore.  AMC's filing on Thursday also does not obligate the company to sell additional shares now or at any time. It merely allows AMC to reserve the right to sell stock.

2021-06-07T18:17:49.000Z,Reddit’s WallStreetBets has a new favorite stockFortune,"GameStop and AMC are trading at levels no one could have imagined a year ago. Now, Reddit’s r/WallStreetBets community is looking for the next company whose stock is set to explode—and seems to have settled on Blackberry. The company behind the once iconic line of pagers and smartphones has seen its shares increase 137% year to date. That’s nothing compared to the 1,472% increase in GameStop and the 2,705% bump for AMC, but it’s the biggest surge the company has seen in two years. And, judging by chatter on r/WallStreetBets, interest is growing. A look at the subreddit Monday finds seven of the top 20 posts are dedicated solely to Blackberry. (Four others are focused on praising Clover Health Investments.) The stock is currently trading in the $15-$16 range, but the most enthusiastic investors are hoping to see it hit $50. “Don’t stop, BBelieving!!” encouraged user TehlorO. Meanwhile, user Substantial_Diver_34 showed a screenshot of what he says is his portfolio that is 100% committed to Blackberry, with over 6,400 shares. It was, at the time of the shot, down $14,000. The post is entitled “What have I done?” Other users gave nothing but encouragement. “I'll tell you what you've done: You've guaranteed your place amongst the millionares,” wrote kingandr3, while Firesice offered “You put in a winning bid...just needs a little time.” WSB bulls say Blackberry has grown from being a phone company to a cybersecurity firm that has deals with [hotlink]Amazon[/hotlink] and others and could be well positioned to take a position in the electric vehicle marketspace. Analysts aren’t as sure. Four firms currently have “Sell” ratings on the company, with only one suggesting investors buy. Of course, the r/WallStreetBets effect often defies the logic of analysts. AMC and [hotlink]GameStop[/hotlink] were floundering a year ago. Now, their stock prices and market caps have increased so much in recent months that they could join the Russell 1000 by the end of the month.

The stock -- like GameStop Corp. before it -- has become a darling of retail traders. The movie-theater chain’s wild rise comes despite questionable fundamentals, prompting concerns among regulators that investors could be sitting on substantial losses if the stock plunges.

2021-06-07T13:33:13.000Z,Surging meme stocks like AMC and GameStop send Russell 2000 skyrocketingYahoo Finance,"Meme stock mania has been mighty kind to the small-cap Russell 2000 Index after its reconstitution last June.  The total market capitalization of the Russell 2000 Index surged 84% from last year’s reconstitution (or the addition and subtraction of new companies to the index) to $3.5 trillion, FTSE Russell said in weekend tweet. This year alone, the Russell 2000 is up more than 16% compared to a 12% gain for the S&P 500. ""In 2020, overall capitalization for the U.S. equity market stayed fairly flat, decreasing by 1%. However, we’ve seen a surge in growth in the first half of 2021 with the total market cap in the Russell 1000 reaching $44.1 trillion. We have also seen a resurgence in market capitalizations of small cap companies in the Russell 2000 reflecting the overall bounce back of U.S. equity markets following the COVID-19 recession in early 2020,"" said FTSE Russell CEO Arne Staal. To be sure, the index has been powered by massive gains in popular stocks among a new army of retail trades such as AMC (AMC) and GameStop (GME).  AMC shares have gained more than 700% in one-year's time, giving the money-losing movie theater chain a whopping $25 billion market cap. As for struggling GameStop, its stock has exploded 4,900% over the past year — it now sports a lofty $17.6 billion market cap. Given each company's bulging market caps, they are likely to be removed from the Russell 1000. The index typically showcases companies with sub $5 billion market caps.  Currently, the smallest company in the Russell 2000 Index is Velocity Financial (VEL). It boasts a market cap of $257.1 million, an increase of 171.2% from $94.8 million in 2020.  FTSE Russell's changes to its various indexes will take place after U.S. stock markets close on June 25. The company points out the reconstitution will impact more than $10.6 trillion in investor assets benchmarked to, or invested in, products based on the Russell U.S. indexes.

Subscribe Thursday, June 3, 2021 When the market moves at the speed of AMC (AMC) it can be hard to keep up.  But all we can tell readers for sure is that the Meme Market is back.  On Wednesday alone, AMC shares nearly doubled, rising 95% to close at a record $62.55. AMC's market cap is now just north of $28 billion. Since the beginning of May, AMC stock is up more than 500%. Year-to-date, shares have gained about 3,000%.  The superlatives can go on. AMC was not alone, however. Shares of Bed, Bath & Beyond (BBBY), Express (EXPR), and BlackBerry (BB) all rose more than 30% on Wednesday. Even our old friends at GameStop (GME) got involved, rising some 13% amid a broad rally in meme names widely discussed on reddit and elsewhere.  But after the GameStop saga of mid-winter came and went, the market's energy moved into areas like NFTs and cryptocurrencies. Dogecoin (DOGE-USD) became a better indicator of risk sentiment than the VIX. In the background of all this the major U.S. stock indexes were treading water, minding their own business as the economy continued to rebound from last year's recession.  Along the way, the Morning Brief highlighted survey data from Deutsche Bank published in late February that suggested retail traders had no plans to leave the market. In April, fund flow data from Bank of America showed retail investors were still buying stocks while institutions were lightening up on their equity exposure.   A redux of this winter's full-on meme market, however, seemed unlikely.  And yet here we are.  The differences between the winter's GameStop episode and the present mania, of course, are many.  There has not yet been the emergence of a broad ""Wall Street vs. Main Street"" dynamic quite yet. Self-promotors from the world of tech, and crypto, and sports betting haven't inserted themselves into the present conversation with the same enthusiasm as was seen back in February. It seems these folks made a quick buck and promoted their own platforms enough the first time around.

2021-06-03T09:32:49.000Z,Option Trade Review: AMC Stock Up 95%; Here's How The Reddit WallStreetBets Crowd Does It,"For today's option review, we're going to take a look at what's going on in AMC, Blackberry and Bed Bath and Beyond stock, as the Reddit WallStreetBets crowd have been targeting these companies once again. [MUSIC PLAYING] RACHEL FOX: Hey, option traders. For today's Option Review, we're going to take a look at what's going on in AMC and a few other stocks, as the Reddit Wallstreetbets crowd is clearly targeted a handful of companies yesterday once again. AMC's stock jumped 95% yesterday. And luckily for call option buyers, they were able to cash in on the massive move throughout the day. AMC, along with other stocks, such as BlackBerry and Bed, Bath, and Beyond, saw massive call option volume as retail traders continued to squeeze institutional investors out of their short trades. AMC, BlackBerry, and Bed, Bath, and Beyond options were the most actively traded of any stock or ETF on the day. So let's take a look at these stocks together to see which specific option contract was the most highly targeted. So we're on my ThinkorSwim dashboard. And first, we're going to look at AMC's stock. So I have the ticker typed in up here. We're going to look at options contracts that expire the week of June 4, which June 4 is tomorrow. So they expire tomorrow. The highest volume contract was the 73 straight calls, which traded over 233,000 contracts. And the calls were up 2,462% on the day. And for BlackBerry, ticker symbol BB, it was the June 4 15-strike call, which is right here. And that one had traded 136,000 contracts. And that's what had the most volume. But there was also the June 18 43-strike call, which is all the way down here. And that saw the biggest percentage gain at 1,450%. Clearly, out-of-the-money calls are a favorite for Wallstreetbets traders. And finally, let's take a look at Bed, Bath, & Beyond saw 35,000 contracts traded in the June 4 calls at the 45 strike. And those calls were up an astounding 11,080% on the day.    ",https://finance.yahoo.com/video/option-trade-review-amc-stock-093249259.html
2021-06-07T19:37:29.000Z,Meme Stock Bulls Take Back Control as Hedge Fund Battle RagesFX Empire,"After a wave of selling heading into the weekend, retail investors have wrestled back control of their favorite shorted stocks, including AMC Entertainment and GameStop. The stocks are off their highs of the day, and retail investors are convinced that something shady is going on. Short sellers are swinging back after losing USD 2.2 billion from AMC’s rally last week. There are theories of traders pulling out all the stops — including the illegal practice of naked shorting, which is currently trending on Twitter. Shares of AMC have galloped 16% today but still failed to cross the psychologically important USD 60 level, where the movie chain stock closed above on June 2 for the first time. While AMC might be off its peak, investors don’t have much to clamor about considering that the stock has skyrocketed more than 467% since early May. Fellow WallStreetBets stock GameStop is tacking on close to 11% in today’s session. The stock has gained more than 1,400% year-to-date for a market cap of USD 19.4 billion. GameStop investors have proven to be a loyal bunch as it hasn’t always been easy to hold. But those who have stuck around continue to be rewarded with more potential runway for gains. Ihor Dusaniwsky, managing director of predictive analytics at S3 Partners, revealed in a tweet that GMC and AMC each have a short squeeze risk score attached of 10 out of a possible 10. Meanwhile, the WallStreetBets crowd has taken over Twitter, with #nakedshorting trending on the social media site. To be clear, unlike regular shorting, which is legal, naked selling is not legal. It has to do with selling shares that have not been issued yet. Nonetheless, it still happens in the market. Naked shorting is how 140% of GameStop’s float can have short interest, as pointed out by Charles Payne on Fox Business. Christian, Smith & Jewell Law Firm Attorney Wes Christian said he blames the prime brokers that are custodying the assets as well as market makers for this behavior.

2021-06-07T17:44:13.000Z,"UPDATE 1-Meme-stock surge lifts AMC, BlackBerry; regulator signals concernReuters","(Updates throughout, adds bylines, quotes)    By Aaron Saldanha, Sinéad Carew and David Randall    June 7 (Reuters) - Shares of AMC Entertainment and other ""meme stocks"" supported by individual traders jumped on Monday, extending a rally in social-media favorites into a third week as message boards hummed with talk about the potential to squeeze Wall Street short-sellers.    The sharp gains, however, have caught the attention of regulators at the Securities and Exchange Commission. On Monday the agency said it is looking into signs of market manipulation given the ""volatility in certain stocks.""    The volatility has also made it challenging for analysts to cover, with two analysts in the past week dropping coverage of GameStop, the stock that was catapulted higher in January by retail investors.    Cinema operator AMC Entertainment Holdings, which almost doubled in value again last week, was last up 21.1% at $58.00 while BlackBlerry's U.S. listing climbed 15.0% to $15.94 and put it up 56% since the start of June. Canadian cannabis producer Tilray's U.S. listing, meanwhile, surged 7.1%.    ""AMC never ceases to amaze me. Just when I think that train is over, it jumps almost 10 points in the first 30 min of trading,"" one poster on Reddit wrote.    Shares of AMC are up more than 2,500% for the year to date as it has courted individual investors, while shares of video game retailer GameStop are up about 1,305% over the same time.    However some bearish investors retreated from bets against AMC on Friday as the stock fell 6.7% that day with short interest falling 74.5 million shares, or 14.9% of AMC's float by the end of trade Friday from 88.2 million on Thursday, according to S3 Partners.    Institutional investors are largely sitting on the sidelines as the meme-stock rally driven by individual investors continues.

2021-06-03T05:37:49.000Z,"AMC Set For New Records, Up 20% Premarket, Blackberry Gains 30%","By Dhirendra Tripathi Investing — Meme stock favorite AMC (NYSE:AMC) looked set for another blockbuster run Thursday, rallying 20% in the premarket, a day after shares more than doubled in a single session. BlackBerry (NYSE:BB) was up too, rising 30% in premarket, while GameStop (NYSE:GME), the original meme stock darling, gained 3%, in line with its relatively subdued trend in recent times. The meme stock rally has been driven by by retail inventors acting together to bid up shares of heavily shorted companies, forcing short sellers to unwind their bets at a loss. AMC has done much more recently beyond offering free popcorn to investors who sign who sign up for its AMC Investor Connect, an initiative to engage directly with its sizable retail shareholders, to attract attention but this demolition of trading records and stock market highs has left many baffled. In less than a month, AMC has raised $658.5 million in equity. Part of this money will be spent on new leases and revamping old theatres. But the pandemic has caused its long-term debt levels to soar to $5.4 billion as of the first three months of this year from less than $2 billion in 2016. And it’s still losing money, with analysts expecting another $100 million to go over the next 12 months. Many experts have warned that retail traders, who are looking for quick money, could end up hurting themselves as the fundamentals of the companies aren’t strong enough to justify current valuations.

MYLES UDLAND: OK, joining us now to talk about the state of the markets and how retail has been playing this market is JJ Kinahan. He's the Chief Market Strategist over at TD Ameritrade. So JJ, right before you came on, you heard us talking about what's happening with the meme names. You guys have your latest survey out of what your investors have moved in and out of the most. And a name that I did not see on that list was AMC. What have you seen on your side in some of these big names that really constitute kind of the core of the meme trade? JJ KINAHAN: Sure. So you know, if you think about it, AMC, GameStop, et cetera, for the last month wasn't necessarily as big a story. It became a bigger story right at the end of the month. What was interesting to me is when I looked at those stocks is that the week before Memorial-- so Memorial Day was a week ago today, it was last week on Tuesday that we really saw these explode. The week before, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday is when we actually saw our clients start to buy those names more. On Tuesday and Wednesday, our clients were more even in terms of their buying and selling of the stocks. So I thought that that part was really, really interesting overall. Obviously, the interest increased pretty significantly. Actually the one name that you didn't talk about but I know is part of the picture-- and just, you guys, it was a great discussion, had a lot to cover there-- was BlackBerry. BlackBerry was a name that in terms of percentage-wise, the volume picked up very significantly. Because GameStop and AMC continue to have this sort of interest all the time. And I thought it was interesting, you know, Julia was comparing some of this when we go down and people come in and buy it, to Tesla. And you know, and the stocks our clients purchased last month, Tesla was one of them, because they did sell off. And I think there was a little bit of a difference-- and it's one of the things you guys were talking about-- and that I also believe in talking to our clients that there's a belief that AMC is also a reopening play as much as a meme stock play, because people think that there is a hunger for movies and good movies, and people like the theater experience.

2021-06-07T20:23:41.000Z,AMC Shares Jump as New Meme-Stock Favorite Returns to FormBloomberg,"(Bloomberg) -- AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. rose for the first day in three amid a broader advance in meme stocks and as regulators warned they are monitoring the frenzied trading in the group of shares for any signs of market manipulation. The stock closed 15% higher at $55 on Monday. Its shares more than doubled on the first two days of a holiday-shortened last week, but gave back some of those gains after insiders cashed in with a flurry of share sales. In a statement Monday, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said it’s monitoring markets for manipulation and other forms of misconduct amid the frenzied surge in so-called meme stocks. “We will act to protect retail investors if violations of federal securities laws are found,” the agency said. Read more: SEC Says It’s Scrutinizing Market Swings as Meme Stocks Surge On the brink of bankruptcy only a few months ago, AMC is now the darling of retail traders, with this year’s near-2,500% gain ranking as the most of any stock in the Russell 3000 Index. That’s despite calls from across Wall Street that the shares aren’t worth anywhere near where they currently trade. “The stock continues to not reflect fundamentals,” said Macquarie analyst Chad Beynon. “Retail traders are focusing on price and not what that translates to in terms of valuations,” he added. Still, the surge has enabled the company to sell equity and shore up its shaky balance sheet. AMC is building a “strategic war chest,” B Riley analyst Eric Wold wrote in a note.“In addition to our continued expectation that AMC could improve its balance sheet and future cash flows through debt repurchases/pay-downs, we could now see either acquisitions of smaller exhibitor chains or the takeover of leases from troubled chains,” he said. Company insiders have also started to take advantage of AMC’s swift run up in share price. At least six people affiliated with the firm sold more than $8 million of stock last week, according to regulatory filings with the SEC. Carla Chavarria, the company’s head of human resources, unloaded $2.5 million worth of shares, while Gary Locke, who is up for re-election to the board, sold more than 34,000 shares for $1.7 million.

ALEXIS CHRISTOFOROUS: A frenzy of buying of AMC stock triggered several trading halts today, with meme stock traders fueling a surge in that stock of more than 100%. The manic trading activity comes despite a report that a hedge fund had sold its stake in the movie theater company. Here to talk about those meme stocks and the market at large is Ryan Nauman, Market Strategist at Zephyr. Ryan, good to have you here. I want to start with the activity we're seeing in AMC today. We're also seeing a little bit of that bleeding over into Bed Bath and Beyond, another so-called meme stock. How much of a threat is this kind of trading to the broader stock market? RYAN NAUMAN: Alexis, first, thank you so much for having me on. It's such a fascinating question. And really, you know, it's been a fascinating story this whole year are the meme stocks. And to me, I don't know if it's so much of a threat to the markets. It's more of a learning experience. And my biggest takeaway from this year is that this is no longer our grandparents', or for that matter, our parents' stock market. Now, investment professionals, they need to start focusing more on looking at alternative data sets, you know, rethinking their investment thesis to consider this growing cohort of retail investors. These retail investors, because of day trading, and for the most part, because of this virtually free money that we've had from the Fed since the pandemic, that their voice is getting much larger due to social media, and they need to be considered when we are coming up with the investment thesis moving forward. And that's what we're seeing with AMC. AMC, the executives there, they're rewarding this retail cohorts with perks due to their fantastic run this year. I think they're up nearly 1,400% year to date, and they're getting rewarded for it. That's what we're going to see moving forward. And investment theses need to consider that moving forward.           ",https://finance.yahoo.com/video/no-longer-grandparents-parents-stock-180120465.html

In the case of AMC, the hottest of them for now, traders may be trying to gauge where the company is headed. After raising $1.24 billion in equity in three installments in less than a month, each at a different price, it filed a preliminary proxy on Thursday seeking permission to sell 25 million more shares in 2022. It has been a roller-coaster for AMC traders who saw their stock double in just one session on Wednesday to hit a high of $83.63, only to fall in double digits on announcement of a new equity raise. The shares closed at $66.80 Friday. The pandemic has caused AMC's long-term debt levels to soar to $5.4 billion as of the first three months of this year from less than $2 billion in 2016. And it’s still losing money, with analysts expecting another $100 million to go over the next 12 months.

2021-06-02T05:48:41.000Z,"Meme Stocks Surge Premarket, AMC Ignores Mudrock Exit For One More Pop","By Dhirendra Tripathi Investing — Meme stocks AMC (NYSE:AMC) and BlackBerry (NYSE:BB) posted double digit gains in premarket Wednesday, as the craze for them refuses to die. AMC was up 32%, on track to open at a record high, while Blackberry (TSX:BB) added 19% and the original darling, GameStop (NYSE:GME) rose 5%. Tuesday’s exit of Mudrock Capital Management from AMC, within a few hours of putting in $230.5 million equity in the multiplex operator, seemed of little significance as its shares seemed set for another blockbuster day. The company will use the cash proceeds to revamp its existing outlets and create more leases. Investor interest in the stock has also heightened as people set out to shop and visit theatres and restaurants after being holed up home for a year. The company has raised $658.5 million equity through two separate exercises in less than a month. AMC, GameStop and Blackberry, have been at the center of an almost six-month-long battle with retail traders on one side and hedge funds and other big institutions on the other. While the big boys have been short on the stock, the small retail traders, using various chat applications and social media chat platforms like Reddit to coordinate their action, have come together to cause a short squeeze on the stocks – a phenomenon where the stock begins to rise against an expected fall, causing losses to those who were positioned to trade on the fall. AMC last week replaced GameStop as the favorite of the Reddit gang, according to Bank of America findings. Many experts have warned that the small savers, who are looking for quick money, could end up hurting themselves as the fundamentals of the companies aren’t strong enough to justify those valuations. The warnings have made little difference as the stocks have mostly maintained their elevated levels, in AMC’s case still making new highs.

2021-06-01T10:30:54.000Z,AMC shares soar nearly 23% after fund buys and flips $230 million stake,"(Reuters) -A hedge fund that helped AMC Entertainment Holdings raise $230 million quickly sold its stake in the world's largest cinema chain at a profit, according to a source on Tuesday, when the ""meme stock"" soared more than 20%. The move by Mudrick Capital Management to flip 8.5 million shares of the movie theater chain immediately after buying them in a private placement from the company shows how Wall Street is getting bolder about making a quick buck off a trading frenzy that has helped fuel big rallies in several stocks favored by retail investors. Easy money from the Federal Reserve has ""created an almost video game-like atmosphere in the stock market and investing,"" said Michael O'Rourke, chief market strategist at Jones Trading. ""There's money flowing everywhere and this is a great illustration of that."" AMC said earlier Tuesday it issued https://sec.report/Document/0001104659-21-074526 8.5 million shares to Mudrick, the chain's latest share sale this year as it cashes in on a big jump in its stock in 2021. Mudrick has sold its AMC stake at a profit, believing the company's shares are overvalued, the source familiar with the matter said on Tuesday. Additional details could not be immediately determined. AMC did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Mudrick's divestiture reported earlier by Bloomberg News. AMC said it would invest the proceeds in its existing theaters, which are set to benefit from a recovery in demand as more states lift COVID-19 restrictions on social gatherings. ""This can be a real way for AMC to grow again, creating immediate value for AMC shareholders,"" Chief Executive Adam Aron wrote in a Twitter thread https://twitter.com/CEOAdam/status/1399683077660721152. ""This is not mindless dilution, but rather this is very smart raising of cash so that we can grow this company."" AMC's stock closed up nearly 23% at $32.04, leading a rally in other meme stocks.            ",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amc-surges-meme-stocks-start-103054396.html
2021-06-01T07:30:42.000Z,"AMC Pops After Latest Fund Raise, Other Meme Stocks Are Partying Too","By Dhirendra Tripathi Investing — Another week but it was business as usual for meme stocks as the likes of AMC (NYSE:AMC), GameStop (NYSE:GME) and BlackBerry (NYSE:BB) were up again in premarket Tuesday. AMC, the latest top draw for the Reddit crowd after replacing GameStop in the league, was up 8%. Blackberry (TSX:BB), a relatively new entrant, was up 7% while the video games retailer was up 3%. In the case of AMC, there was some news too. The theatre chain said it has raised $230.5 million from sale of 8.5 million Class A Common stock at approximately $27.12 per share. This is AMC’s second big fund raise in less than three weeks. It had then raised $428 million via sale of 43 million shares at $9.94 apiece. Since the May 13 announcement, the shares have trebled below closing a trifle lower Friday. The story mostly began in January, when some Reddit followers decided to take on the big hedge funds who were short on GameStop. That unexpected coming together of widely distributed retail investors resulted in a short squeeze in the stock and created trouble for the institutional traders. One even went under. Since then, the battle between the big institutional guys and the small retail traders, large number of whom are on Robinhood, has waged on. There was a lull in between but last few weeks have brought back the invisible fight between the small, mostly young, retail traders and the big boys. In the process, all doomsday projections of small investors burning themselves have come to naught as meme stocks stay at elevated levels.

Volumes are low, as is volatility. That said, let’s look at a few top stock trades going into next week, a four-day trading week in the U.S. Click to Enlarge Source: Chart courtesy of TrendSpider Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is among the large- and mega-cap tech stocks that just can’t seem to garner much upside momentum. With its WWDC event just around the corner, perhaps this one can start to gain some momentum. Specifically, I’m keeping an eye on the $128 to $129 area. If Apple can push above this zone next week, it will give bulls a two-times weekly-up rotation, as well as a close above the 10-week and 21-week moving averages. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Clearing this mark could open the door to the $135 to $138 area. On the downside, the lows have been pretty tempered lately, but if we get a flush lower, I’m looking to buy a potential dip down to the $120 area. There Apple finds the 200-day, 50-week and 10-month moving averages. 7 Best Stocks for Upcoming Grads to Buy and Hold Forever That area should be support. Click to Enlarge Source: Chart courtesy of TrendSpider I know there are some pretty diehard bulls out there for BlackBerry (NYSE:BB). I’m not one of them necessarily, but when the short squeeze is on, it’s hard to ignore this stock. Shares rallied right to the prior supply/demand zone near $12.15 and was harshly rejected. This area was also resistance in February and March. If the stock can push through $12.15, a run to $14 or higher is possible. On the downside, I want to see the 10-day moving average act as support, along with $9.33. $9.33 was prior support turned resistance, so it’s important to see this level support BlackBerry. If it doesn’t, a move lower is possible.                   ",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/4-top-stock-trades-tuesday-213833538.html

2021-05-28T13:36:17.000Z,AMC pops as Reddit traders double down,"Yahoo Finance’s Julie Hyman, Myles Udland, and Brian Sozzi discuss the latest action in the Reddit-fueled meme stocks craze, and break down why the rally isn’t going away anytime soon. MYLES UDLAND: All right, let's take a look now at the meme trade because as we mentioned, I mean, it is full on back in this market. AMC is now the star of the show, taking over from GameStop. But let us not sleep on GameStop, which has had a huge week. AMC shares, as we noted in the premarket, up about 15%. And Julie, we see the heat map here of some of these meme names. But I am just shocked to see AMC up about 35% over the last week, up 17% in premarket trade. And we talked to Rich Greenfield a week ago. And he was sort of, like, telling us, reminding us that this is still a very much a passionate Reddit trade. And I think I had certainly fallen asleep on it. And here we are, with gains now looking-- stocks basically doubled in just a couple of weeks. JULIE HYMAN: Yeah, and you know how he reminded us, he said that AMC is not a good business and still is in secular decline. I wrote up that story and got quite a lot of Twitter hate from folks who are still short squeezing that stock. So that was a little bit of a wake up call for me personally to know that people on Reddit were still paying attention to the likes of an AMC. Pretty incredible, isn't it? I'm actually going to switch on over since we're looking at AMC because I am curious to look at that sort of longer term chart. There's a two-year chart of AMC. I mean, look at that thing. It's just kind of amazing. The thing was obviously left for dead, right? And then we saw the initial spike, the spike now, obviously, larger even than that. We got some interesting numbers, by the way, from Bespoke Investment Group that also talks about sort of the magnitude of the activity around AMC. They report-- they said that yesterday, AMC stock alone made up nearly 2/3 of the New York Stock Exchange consolidated turnover. And they said the NYSE is only one trading venue, but still, even as a sample, it was consisting of so much of that trading volume and turnover, $16 billion traded. It's just kind of staggering to think about, guys.                 ",https://finance.yahoo.com/video/amc-pops-reddit-traders-double-133617963.html
2021-05-27T23:00:00.000Z,Could This Be The No.1 EV Stock Of 2021?,"While Tesla and Volkswagen compete for EV buyers, a winner of their battles for customers may be another billion-dollar company that doesn’t even make cars called Facedrive. That might come as a surprise after the banner year Tesla had in 2020. In just the last 12 months, Tesla has seen an incredible 503% gain in its stock price. And they’ve continued to dominate the industry in many parts of the world thanks to their superior battery costs and massive advantage in their cutting-edge software. Volkswagen has been a late arrival to the EV scene but is quickly working to close the gap with Tesla. By 2025, VW plan to scale up production to sell more than 2 million electric vehicles and become the second largest software company in all of Europe. And as they ramp up, experts are now expecting they could just pass Tesla in terms of sales, selling 300,000 more electric vehicles than their competitor in the next few years. In fact, they’re so set on putting their name behind the EV wave that they even joked recently about changing the name of their US arm to Voltswagen. The battle for the throne of the EV world has become so contentious that headlines have been popping up non-stop featuring these two industry titans. The New York Times says, “Volkswagen aims to use its size to head off Tesla.” CNN reports, “Volkswagen could soon steal Tesla’s crown.” And Bloomberg says, “If Tesla is the Apple of electric cars, Volkswagen is betting it can be Samsung.” But it’s possible they’re both operating under a fundamental misunderstanding. And while it’s hard to believe the electric vehicle craze could slow down after the hot streak the market has had throughout 2020 and into this year, the numbers don’t lie. That’s because, for the first time in decades, private car ownership numbers are moving in the other direction. So while Tesla and Volkswagen are ramping up to produce more and more electric vehicles, the number of no-car families is finally on the rise again.

If you want to skip our detailed analysis of these companies, go directly to the 5 Popular Stocks Reddit's WallStreetBets is Talking About Today. The meme stock rallies that shook the market at the turn of the year and led to regulatory probes in the United States appear to have returned to haunt financial experts in the past few days. If previous trends are anything to go by, the finance world should expect retail investors, who use internet platforms like Reddit and Twitter, as well as trading applications like Robinhood, to group themselves and collectively bet against big finance positions on certain stocks in the coming days.  One of the most popular places where these retail investors exchange ideas is the Reddit community named WallStreetBets. The forum has more than 10 million members who share thousands of posts about the market each day. Earlier this week, the share price of GameStop Corp. (NYSE: GME), the video game retailer at the center of the meme stock rally a few months ago, jumped more than 13% as Reddit speculation rose that GameStop Corp. (NYSE: GME) would be entering the non-fungible token market.  Another popular stock on the internet platform is MicroVision, Inc. (NASDAQ: MVIS), the technology company most famous for marketing lidar sensors used in autonomous vehicles. In late April, MicroVision, Inc. (NASDAQ: MVIS) stock jumped more than 26% as WallStreetBets members highlighted the company in their forums in a short squeeze push. These retail investors usually favor companies with high short interest. About 20% of the shares of MicroVision, Inc. (NASDAQ: MVIS) were held short last month.  In the past few days, the Redditors have also been interested in BlackBerry Limited (NYSE: BB), the Canadian software company that provides encryption and security services. BlackBerry Limited (NYSE: BB) is one of the most undervalued technology stocks on the market considering the upside potential it has as a leader in cybersecurity innovation. On May 17, BlackBerry Limited (NYSE: BB) announced new prevention-first and artificial intelligence-driven products related to endpoint and network security capabilities.

Jared Blikre is here with a closer look at some of the stocks with-- making some big moves today. And you have got your eye on the meme stocks and some cryptocurrencies, which seem to be bouncing back, Jared. JARED BLIKRE: Yeah, I'll tell you what. Let's start with the meme stocks. And I got a heat map up there on the YFi Interactive. I haven't seen this much green in this proportion or these proportions in several months. You'd have to go back to March. And what stands out is a lot of these are the old GameStop related names that were first kind of pumped in this to the moon endeavor right here. And we can see in GameStop, it's basically been consolidating for several months. And that gives it the power to boost to really accelerate out of this downtrend here. So this is a very bold technical setup for GameStop. AMC is looking even better. You can see it's taken out these highs right here for March. And it's closing in on these highs from February, late January, which was the original GameStop period. So, pretty incredible action there in some of these names. You know, the back story on AMC, they've been raising capital. It's a reopening story. Go back to GameStop, there was some news yesterday centered around a job posting on their site. If you go to nft.gamestop.com, you can see they're looking for Ethereum developers. So the stock is still kind of a black box on a fundamental perspective. We don't really know what they're going to do just yet, but really interesting to see investors taking a hold of this new information. And we've got to check out crypto, too. And here we go. We can see Bitcoin is up 2%, Ether, 5%. Let's see, what's Dogecoin doing? Not seeing it right here, but Ripple's up 5 as well. So it's been a pretty good day for a lot of the FOMO instruments that we saw pick up so much steam earlier in the year.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s SpaceX needs tons of it. Musk says this gas costs him more than liquid oxygen, and prices are about to skyrocket. Google, owned by Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) needs this gas for a novel way to offer rural areas internet--from the stratosphere, and streaming giant Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) has joined the list of major consumers of this gas for its massive data storage. A new discovery would help science and medicine. It will save money for big data, too. And is critical for fiber optic cables, semiconductor chips, and superconductors. It might even be the life of the party … NASA and Space X space missions need it. And without a new discovery, tech giants like Alphabet, SpaceX, Microsoft, IBM, and even Netflix will suddenly find that what used to be a commodity taken for granted is now priced to reflect a short squeeze. The gas is helium. And we’re running out--fast. It’s abundant in the universe, but more rare on earth, and almost no one’s been seriously exploring for it. Until now. The team at Avanti Energy Inc. (TSX: AVN.V; US OTC: ARGYF) has already made a discovery in Canada’s prized Montney, for Encana. That’s one of the richest natural gas deposits in the world. And the team is using the same methodology to explore for what it hopes will prove to be some of the richest helium deposits in the world. Now, they're back to explore again, but this time, they’re not just looking for helium as a by-product of natural gas--they’re looking for the mother lode of helium to feed the big tech, big data needs.

2021-05-18T13:13:01.000Z,BlackBerry (BB) Boosts Cybersecurity With Innovative Solutions,"In a bid to strengthen its extended detection and response roadmap, BlackBerry Limited BB has unveiled two avant-garde cybersecurity solutions to tackle the exponential rate of dynamic threat incidences. Dubbed BlackBerry Optics 3.0 and BlackBerry Gateway, the platforms are specifically designed to automate workflows and enable effective detection and response to gain greater visibility into an organization’s security environment.

As a leading player in the enterprise mobility management, the Canada-based company is widely recognized for productivity and security innovations. In sync with this, the recent product launches are expected to not only facilitate enterprises to centrally manage mobile device and endpoint security in a unified manner but also mitigate malicious cyber threats on the back of a Zero Trust approach, wherein organizations assume that every endpoint or user is possibly hostile until their identity is corroborated to reduce network access risks.

Markedly, BlackBerry Optics 3.0 is a new-age cloud-based endpoint detection and response (EDR) offering that detects security threats and prompts automated responses on-device with AI-driven security for operational resilience. This cloud-enabled platform capitalizes on EDR technologies, and allows root cause analysis to provide analysts with a first-hand access to contextualized endpoint data.

Equipped with machine learning technology, it assists security operations center to detect early signs of malicious activities and delivers private network visibility. In addition, its new cloud-native “data lake” architecture is vouched for by security professionals due to its ability to offer flexible storage options for forensic data. As a matter of fact, data lake is a repository of both unprocessed and processed data that are utilized in multiple tasks such as advanced analytics and reporting.

BlackBerry Gateway is another state-of-the-art solution that operates on the “Prevent First and Protect First approach”. The approach ensures users to get the best of AI-assisted threat detection and secure network connectivity across any device remotely. Touted as BlackBerry’s first AI-empowered, privacy-friendly Zero Trust Network Access product, the superior cloud-enabled offering provides seamless access to on-premises applications for the distributed workforce without the requirement of a virtual private network.

With the rising demand for cloud-based services, an augmented network perimeter to protect confidential data seems to be the need of the hour. Notably, BlackBerry Gateway curbs potential risk factors like social-engineering and phishing attacks that might jeopardize the day-to-day operations of an organization. Driven by these robust characteristics, the solutions will not only address organizations’ security concerns but also boost BlackBerry’s extended portfolio of innovative solutions in the field of cybersecurity and data privacy. With BlackBerry Gateway being currently available, BlackBerry Optics 3.0 will be accessible in the second quarter of 2021.

Moving ahead, BlackBerry intends to drive healthy revenue growth and increase market share in the industry vertical. The cybersecurity software company offers one of the most secure mobile enterprise solutions in the market through a wide portfolio of products and services. With a holistic growth model, focusing on organic and inorganic initiatives, BlackBerry aims to expand its market share in the enterprise mobility segment. It continues to invest in product development and go-to-market strategy, including strong channel partnerships, to drive long-term sustainable growth, thereby instilling optimism.

The stock has gained 89.1% in the past year compared with growth of 56.1% of the industry.   ",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/blackberry-bb-boosts-cybersecurity-innovative-131301713.html
2021-05-17T12:00:00.000Z,BlackBerry Builds Out Extended Detection and Response (XDR) Capabilities with New Cybersecurity Innovations,"Company launches next-gen BlackBerry® Optics 3.0 and BlackBerry® Gateway for ZTNA WATERLOO, ON, May 17, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- BlackBerry Limited (NYSE: BB; TSX: BB) today announced BlackBerry® Optics 3.0, its next-generation cloud-based endpoint detection and response (EDR) solution and BlackBerry® Gateway, the company's first AI-empowered Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA) product. Rooted in a prevention-first and AI-driven approach, BlackBerry's new endpoint and network security capabilities will help differentiate BlackBerry's extended detection and response (XDR) strategy. According to Forrester1, ""XDR unifies EDR with other security and business tooling. EDR gives granular visibility and provides precise response actions for endpoints. However, it lacks visibility and response actions for other parts of the business, like non-endpoint related network telemetry, email behaviors, and cloud environments, leaving security analytics to pick up the slack. XDR provides needed visibility and control to other parts of the business through integrations that combine EDR data with other types of telemetry."" The new cloud-native architecture and Advanced Query capability that underpins Optics 3.0 is integral to BlackBerry's XDR strategy. With Optics 3.0, Edge AI threat detection and automated response capabilities execute directly on the endpoint device so an incident can be mitigated in near real-time. The resulting telemetry, alert, and forensic data gets stored in the cloud data lake along with non-endpoint related telemetry data. Security professionals can then query and analyze the multiple source of telemetry data to gain greater visibility and context into an organization's security environment. BlackBerry Gateway marks the company's entry into ZTNA for both SaaS and on-premises applications. Built with a ""Prevent First and Protect First"" approach, Gateway's Zero Trust architecture helps organizations reduce network access risk by assuming every user, endpoint, and network is potentially hostile until identity is authenticated. As the company builds out its XDR architecture, Gateway would provide ZTNA telemetry data that would be added to the cloud data lake.

But looking back over the last year, the returns have actually been rather pleasing! In that time we've seen the stock easily surpass the market return, with a gain of 64%. See our latest analysis for BlackBerry Because BlackBerry made a loss in the last twelve months, we think the market is probably more focussed on revenue and revenue growth, at least for now. When a company doesn't make profits, we'd generally expect to see good revenue growth. That's because fast revenue growth can be easily extrapolated to forecast profits, often of considerable size. In the last year BlackBerry saw its revenue shrink by 14%. Despite the lack of revenue growth, the stock has returned a solid 64% the last twelve months. To us that means that there isn't a lot of correlation between the past revenue performance and the share price, but a closer look at analyst forecasts and the bottom line may well explain a lot. The image below shows how earnings and revenue have tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail). If you are thinking of buying or selling BlackBerry stock, you should check out this FREE detailed report on its balance sheet. It's good to see that BlackBerry has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 64% in the last twelve months. That's better than the annualised return of 3% over half a decade, implying that the company is doing better recently. Someone with an optimistic perspective could view the recent improvement in TSR as indicating that the business itself is getting better with time. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand BlackBerry better, we need to consider many other factors.

Its founding chairman, Irving Kahn, got his start shortly before the stock market crash of 1929, and the firm's original strategy was based on Benjamin Graham's school of value investing. Over time, Kahn Brothers (Trades, Portfolio)' investment philosophy has changed to more of a contrarian value strategy, focusing on metrics such as margin of safety and long-term capital appreciation. The firm's biggest trades for the quarter were reductions of its holdings in VOXX International Corp. (NASDAQ:VOXX) and BlackBerry Ltd. (NYSE:BB). Although the firm did not invest in the common stocks of any new names over the period in question, it did make additions to existing holdings in New York Community Bancorp Inc.

You can skip our comprehensive analysis of these stocks and go directly to the 5 Best Tech Stocks to Buy Right Now Under $10. Technology firms have witnessed explosive growth over the past few years as internet penetration and cheap, mass produced electronic devices transform the everyday lives of individuals. Statistics from the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics show a huge decline in price of computers, televisions, and related devices over the past two decades. Between 1997 and 2015, the Consumer Price Index for personal computers and peripheral equipment declined 96 percent. The increasing internet and computing penetration would boost the technology industry in the coming years. Most of the decline in the price of computing devices occurred at the turn of the millennium as the dotcom boom rocked the finance world. Since technology hardware was getting cheaper, the technology-related services sector started taking off. In the years since, online shopping giant Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) has emerged as a disruptor in the retail sector, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) has morphed into the biggest company in the world, and Facebook, Inc. (NASDAQ: FB) has become the home away from home for almost half the globe.  Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL), and Facebook, Inc. (NASDAQ: FB), along with two other tech giants, now account for more than 20% of the S&P 500. They have become literally too big to fail. Their share price trades in the hundreds or thousands, and for many average investors, these ships have sailed. However, for those looking to capitalize on changing market dynamics, there are several cheaper options that offer value for money in the tech sector and are stable enough to be a good long term investment. Nokia Corporation (NYSE: NOK), a Finnish firm once popular for making mobile phones, is now one of the leading 5G internet technology providers in the world. Since 5G offers limitless potential for growth in several sectors of the economy, there is a sound reason to bet big on Nokia Corporation (NYSE: NOK) stock that is trading well below $10 right now. Nokia Corporation (NYSE: NOK) has been around for more than a century and a half, and has time and again proved itself capable of navigating through different business conditions.

Shares have added about 10.3% in that time frame, outperforming the S&P 500. Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is BlackBerry due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts. BlackBerry Q4 Earnings in Sync Despite Lower Revenues

BlackBerry reported lackluster fourth-quarter fiscal 2021 (ended Feb 28, 2021) results, with the bottom line matching the Zacks Consensus Estimate despite lower revenues year over year owing to a challenging macroeconomic environment. Post the earnings release, shares fell significantly in pre-market trading as investors probably expected healthy top-line figure. However, QNX design wins and notable cybersecurity partnerships bode well. The company is also witnessing significant traction in the Spark business.  On a GAAP basis, net loss in the quarter was $315 million or loss of 56 cents per share compared with a net loss of $41 million or loss of 7 cents per share in the prior-year quarter. The wider year-over-year loss was mainly due to top-line contraction and fair value adjustment on the convertible debentures.

Non-GAAP earnings came in at $16 million or 3 cents per share compared with $51 million or 9 cents per share in the year-ago quarter. The bottom line matched the Zacks Consensus Estimate.

In fiscal 2021, net loss (GAAP) was $1,104 million or loss of $1.97 per share compared with a net loss (GAAP) of $152 million or loss of 32 cents per share in fiscal 2020. Non-GAAP earnings came in at $101 million or 18 cents per share compared with $74 million or 13 cents per share in fiscal 2020. Owing to the challenges from the COVID-19 pandemic, quarterly total GAAP revenues decreased to $210 million from $282 million in the year-ago quarter. Non-GAAP revenues in the quarter were $215 million. While Software and Services revenues aggregated $165 million, Licensing contributed $50 million to total non-GAAP revenues.

2021-04-08T12:02:12.000Z,"BlackBerry (BB) Inks Deal With Volvo Group, Shares Rise","Driven by its technology leadership, BlackBerry Limited BB recently announced that it has teamed up with a leading Swedish automobile manufacturing company — Volvo Group. Per the alliance, BlackBerry will integrate its proprietary technology, BlackBerry QNX software, across Volvo Group’s diverse base of heavy vehicles. Following the announcement, BlackBerry’s shares soared as high as $9.51 in yesterday’s trading session.

Markedly, the integration reflects the automobile giant’s strategy to take advantage of the right software and components for safe and secure architecture of the next-gen vehicles. Volvo Group’s decision to select BlackBerry’s QNX software for its main domain controller ECUs (engine control unit) was solidified post a thorough proof of concept, demonstrating its feasibility to support the future generation of autonomous driving and electrification.

Pre-integration with various suppliers of the Adaptive AUTOSAR, an enhanced software standard for the automotive industry, was a contributing factor as well. Notably, the partnership aims to harness the capabilities of QNX Operating System (OS) to be on par with the industry safety standards.

With more than 40 years of experience in the manufacture of safety certified embedded software, BlackBerry QNX caters to the connected and autonomous vehicle industry with a wide portfolio of safety-certified solutions. These include infotainment, connectivity, in-car network security, type-1 hypervisor supporting multiple engine control unit integration into domain controllers, advanced driver-assistance systems and acoustics.

QNX OS is an ISO 26262 ASIL-D safety-certified software solution that streamlines certifications to address both performance and reliability requirements. It operates on the back of a real-time operating system and hypervisor, and is ideal for use in aerospace, medical, industrial controls and robotics sectors, among others.

Installed in more than 175 million vehicles, the software is vouched by several Tier 1 and original equipment manufacturers across the globe. Markedly, the inclusion of QNX software will aid Volvo Group to not only drive innovation but also highlight the importance of a standard OS in the commercial vehicles for a sustainable transport system.

Per the recent engagement, Volvo Group will create its ‘Volvo Dynamic Software Platform’ on the back of QNX Hypervisor for Safety and QNX OS for Safety, both of which are touted as the ideal platform to overcome any challenges related to automation and connectivity. That said, the latest deal seems to be the call of the hour as majority of the auto companies are shifting toward state-of-the-art technology to enhance vehicles’ software content while remaining committed to aligning with the highest safety standards.

BlackBerry’s foray into the automotive industry was marked by the seamless integration of navigation, infotainment and critical driving functions. The company leverages its extensive technology portfolio to extend the best-in-class security and reliability features. These include a unified endpoint management solution that provides comprehensive multiplatform device, application and content management with integrated security and connectivity, embedded systems and related services.

As a prime player in the enterprise mobility management, BlackBerry is widely recognized for productivity and security innovations. The company offers one of the most secure mobile enterprise solutions in the market through a broad portfolio of products and services.

To realize its vision for the electronic architecture of future generations of vehicles, Volvo Group wanted to take a new approach to software. It wanted to find a single supplier for the operating system (OS) and hypervisor to meet the needs of the 'whole truck', capable of supporting safety certification to the highest levels. Following an in-depth proof of concept, Volvo Group decided to build its 'Volvo Dynamic Software Platform' (VDSP) on the QNX® OS for Safety and the QNX® Hypervisor for Safety, both certified to ISO 26262:2018 ASIL D. The engagement includes a new flexible use of the QNX OS and Hypervisor for the whole vehicle, which gives developers and architects the freedom to design the best possible system as the company looks at the requirements of the next 15 years, including the future support of autonomous driving and electrification.

Plus, with high levels of Portable Operating System Interface (POSIX) compliance, engineers building on BlackBerry QNX can write software for a wide range of applications with a common API.

2021-04-02T07:03:35.000Z,Here's What BlackBerry Limited's (TSE:BB) Shareholder Ownership Structure Looks Like,"The big shareholder groups in BlackBerry Limited (TSE:BB) have power over the company. Institutions will often hold stock in bigger companies, and we expect to see insiders owning a noticeable percentage of the smaller ones. Companies that used to be publicly owned tend to have lower insider ownership. BlackBerry has a market capitalization of CA$6.1b, so it's too big to fly under the radar. We'd expect to see both institutions and retail investors owning a portion of the company. In the chart below, we can see that institutional investors have bought into the company. Let's delve deeper into each type of owner, to discover more about BlackBerry. Check out our latest analysis for BlackBerry Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing. BlackBerry already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of BlackBerry, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too. Hedge funds don't have many shares in BlackBerry. PRIMECAP Management Company is currently the company's largest shareholder with 10% of shares outstanding. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 8.3% and 2.6% of the stock. Additionally, the company's CEO John Chen directly holds 1.3% of the total shares outstanding.           ",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-blackberry-limiteds-tse-bb-070335574.html

Yahoo Finance’s Julie Hyman, Myles Udland and Brian Sozzi break down the details. MYLES UDLAND: Let's turn our attention from the economy back to what's happening in the corporate world, still have some earnings rolling out focused on the retail sector. Brian Sozzi, Let's start with what we're seeing over at Lululemon. Stock is off just a hair this morning following their results. It's been an interesting couple of years for Lulu. Obviously, they were such a big winner 17, 18 million to 19. A pre-pandemic winner let's say, and they've certainly benefited from some athleisure trend, they've benefited from the broader market, but the stock now over the last couple of quarters kind of done nothing. It is off its highs and I think an interesting kind of question mark here for investors about what the next leg of growth for Lulu-- which is, again, a brand and story that has certainly solidified its place among those kind of elite millennial brands. But where does the stock go from here is the real question. BRIAN SOZZI: Well the stock's, so far today, Miles, under pressure, down about 2% in the premarket. I would say this-- I would call it profit-taking is very much deserved just coming off of the Lululemon earnings call last night. A couple of red flags worth highlighting here, they noted their product margins-- how much margin they make on each product they sell, hence product margins-- product margins down 60 basis points in the quarter. Not what you would be normally seeing from a Lululemon. Some concern out there, you know, just in getting the pulse of Wall Street this morning, the analysts that cover this stock, some concern on whether Lululemon's product margins have peaked, which is worth asking. I just paid $130 for a pair of Lulu pants. They're great, but how much further can you charge for stretchy pants that you're going to wear probably four or five hours during the day when you go back to the office? Nonetheless, some concerns about product margins.             ",https://finance.yahoo.com/video/lululemon-dips-despite-earnings-beat-133835118.html

Post the earnings release, shares fell significantly in pre-market trading as investors probably expected healthy top-line figure. However, QNX design wins and notable cybersecurity partnerships bode well. The company is also witnessing significant traction in the Spark business. On a GAAP basis, net loss in the quarter was $315 million or loss of 56 cents per share compared with a net loss of $41 million or loss of 7 cents per share in the prior-year quarter. The wider year-over-year loss was mainly due to top-line contraction and fair value adjustment on the convertible debentures.

Non-GAAP earnings came in at $16 million or 3 cents per share compared with $51 million or 9 cents per share in the year-ago quarter. The bottom line matched the Zacks Consensus Estimate.

In fiscal 2021, net loss (GAAP) was $1,104 million or loss of $1.97 per share compared with a net loss (GAAP) of $152 million or loss of 32 cents per share in fiscal 2020. Non-GAAP earnings came in at $101 million or 18 cents per share compared with $74 million or 13 cents per share in fiscal 2020.

The company recorded significant progress in both the Government and Financial Services verticals within the Spark business.

In fiscal 2021, GAAP revenues were $893 million, down from $1,040 million in fiscal 2020.           ",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/blackberry-bb-q4-earnings-sync-130201464.html
2021-03-31T09:48:43.000Z,"Blackberry Shares Tumble On Revenue Miss, Ignoring Analyst Upgrade","By Dhirendra Tripathi Investing.com – BlackBerry (NYSE:BB) shares fell a sharp 9% Wednesday after the company’s February quarter revenue came in below expectations. BlackBerry matched estimates with adjusted quarterly earnings of 3 cents per share. But revenue of $210 million for the quarter was down 25% from a year ago. The net loss of $315 million was more than seven times from a year ago. The company blamed its ongoing negotiations for a potential sale of a part of its portfolio for the dip in revenue. The sale involves part of the patent portfolio relating primarily to mobile devices, messaging and wireless networking, the company said. The takeaways from the earnings announcement impressed Canaccord Genuity analyst Michael Walkley, who upgraded BlackBerry to hold from sell, revising its target for the stock to $9. Should the sale of its licensing business happen, it could help unlock value and provide a capital infusion to drive accelerated software and services growth, Walkley said in a note. He expects software and services fundamentals to improve.

BlackBerry’s (BB) 4Q earnings of $0.03 per share declined 66.7% year-over-year and were in-line with the Street’s estimates. Lower top-line revenues and a contraction in gross and operating margins led to the earnings decline. Adjusted revenues of $215 million fell 26.1% year-over-year and missed analysts’ estimates of $246.4 million. Adjusted software and services revenue declined 13.7% year-over-year. The company’s CEO John Chen said, “We are seeing tangible signs that our efforts and improvements in go-to-market are starting to pay off and have a positive impact.” Chen added, “This quarter we generated strong sequential billings growth for our Software and Services business, including significant improvements for both Spark and QNX. Total billings are back to pre-pandemic levels.” (See BlackBerry stock analysis on TipRanks) On Feb. 16, Canaccord Genuity analyst Michael Walkley cut his rating to Sell from Hold due to the recent run-up in the stock amid the improvement in the company’s security software business. Walkley lifted the price target to $10 (7.1% upside potential) from $8 as he expects a “gradual software and services recovery,” with positive revenue growth this year as the analyst expects an improvement in automotive sales. Meanwhile, the Street has a Strong Sell consensus rating on the stock based on 3 Sells. The average analyst price target of $8.70 implies downside potential of about 6.9% to current levels. Shares have gained over 145% in one year. On TipRanks’ Smart Score ranking, BlackBerry gets a 3 out of 10 suggesting that the stock is likely to underperform market expectations. Related News:

BlackBerry’s QNX car software, which is used by likes of Volkswagen AG (OTC: VWAGY) and Ford Motor Company (NYSE: F), is facing demand pressures due to the slow recovery in the U.S. auto industry and a global shortage of semiconductors. “This has been an exceptional year to navigate, however we are pleased with QNX’s continued recovery, despite new challenges from the global chip shortage,” said John Chen, CEO of BlackBerry, as per Reuters.

During the quarter BlackBerry entered into an exclusive negotiation with a North American entity for the potential sale of part of the patent portfolio relating primarily to mobile devices, messaging and wireless networking. The Company has limited its patent monetization activities due to the ongoing negotiations. If the Company had not been in negotiations during the quarter, we believe that Licensing revenue would have been higher. Non-GAAP earnings per basic and diluted share of $0.03; GAAP loss per basic and diluted share of $0.56. GAAP loss per share was largely driven by a non-cash accounting adjustment on the convertible debentures, resulting from market conditions.

2021-03-30T13:14:01.000Z,BlackBerry (BB) QNX Software Boosts Scania's Heavy Vehicles,"BlackBerry Limited BB recently announced that it has joined forces with a leading Swedish manufacturer of heavy vehicles — Scania AB. Per the deal, the company’s much acclaimed, proprietary technology, BlackBerry QNX software, will be incorporated into Scania’s high performance computing platforms in heavy vehicles.

The company will leverage the QNX Operating System (OS) to be on par with the industry safety standards as part of the collaboration. Markedly, the addition of QNX software will aid Scania to not only drive innovation but also emphasize the significance of a standard OS in the next-gen vehicles for a sustainable transport system.

With more than 40 years of experience in the manufacture of safety certified embedded software, BlackBerry QNX caters to the connected and autonomous vehicle industry with a wide portfolio of safety-certified solutions. These include infotainment, connectivity, in-car network security, type-1 hypervisor supporting multiple engine control unit integration into domain controllers, advanced driver-assistance systems and acoustics.

The integration will enable the transport solutions provider to avail the benefits of a safety certified OS within its new-age heavy goods vehicles on the back of a single software base.

Notably, the single OS will aid Scania to modernize its operations and deliver customer value to market with utmost efficiency. That said, the latest deal seems to be the call of the hour as majority of the auto companies are migrating toward state-of-the-art technology to enhance vehicles’ software content while remaining committed to aligning with the highest safety standards.

BlackBerry’s foray into the automotive industry was marked by the seamless integration of navigation, infotainment and critical driving functions. The company leverages its extensive technology portfolio to extend the best-in-class security and reliability features. These include a unified endpoint management solution that provides comprehensive multiplatform device, application and content management with integrated security and connectivity, embedded systems and related services.

With a holistic growth model, focusing on organic and inorganic initiatives, BlackBerry aims to expand its market share in the enterprise mobility segment. The company’s solid product cycle, coupled with impending launches of new secure communication products and services, instills optimism.

The stock has soared 122.8% in the past year compared with growth of 89% of the industry. It remains to be seen if such technological endeavors can boost the stock in the long run.   ",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/blackberry-bb-qnx-software-boosts-131401822.html

What Are Earnings, Net Income, And Earnings Per Share? Earnings and especially earnings per share (EPS) are useful measures of a company's profitability.

2021-03-29T13:16:01.000Z,"BlackBerry (BB) Unveils IVY Innovation Fund, Fosters Startups","In an effort to revolutionize the future of transportation with emerging technologies, BlackBerry Limited BB recently unveiled the IVY Innovation Fund. The fund aims to accelerate the overall automotive ecosystem, and enable both new and established market players to develop data-driven solutions, thereby enhancing passenger and driver experiences. This will be made possible with BlackBerry IVY’s AI insights and Amazon Web Services (“AWS”), an on-demand cloud computing platform of tech giant — Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN.

Interestingly, in December 2020, BlackBerry and AWS had inked a multi-year global agreement for the development of a secure and intelligent connected vehicle software platform for in-vehicle applications — BlackBerry IVY. The scalable, cloud-connected software platform has been specifically designed to integrate BlackBerry QNX real-time operating system with AWS’ IoT services in the cloud and in the car to develop a comprehensive edge-to-cloud offering for diversified car brands.

Markedly, the game-changing deal enables both the developers and automakers to leverage crucial data and connectivity in an effort to tap lucrative opportunities without having to compromise on customer privacy or safety. Automakers can utilize the data to devise responsive in-vehicle services and expand BlackBerry’s relationship with AWS, thereby enhancing revenues and designing new business models based on vehicle data.

Notably, the latest move underscores BlackBerry’s commitment to introducing new-age connected vehicle solutions that will not only nurture developers to build their businesses but also leverage effective data insights to redefine the dynamics of the transportation industry.

As part of its association with AWS, the BlackBerry IVY Innovation Fund allows tech companies to access the benefits of AWS Activate, wherein they can avail AWS credits of up to $100,000. AWS Activate is an innovative program that helps startups to thrive supported by a perfect mix of tools and expertise. Apart from AWS Activate, one can access BlackBerry’s robust pipeline of cybersecurity and automotive solutions. At first, the fund will allocate up to $50 million.

This amount will be used to support startup companies, fleet operators, original equipment manufacturers and smart mobility providers to develop data-driven solutions and bolster new offerings. Backed by such state-of-the-art facilities, the BlackBerry IVY Innovation Fund is likely to emerge as a trailblazing tool, which will not only augment the ecosystem of innovative transportation solutions but also foster the community of developers to create such solutions.

2021-03-26T19:43:59.000Z,BB Stock: One Big Reason the r/WallStreetBets Star Is Stumbling Today,"BlackBerry (NYSE:BB) stock is down nearly 4% today after agreeing to stop reporting non-GAAP (generally acceptable accounting practices) earnings in response to a comment letter from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. BB stock has been reporting non-GAAP earnings alongside GAAP earnings since the first quarter of fiscal year 2019. Source: Shutterstock The comment letter from the SEC said in part that “non-GAAP adjustments [were] intended to eliminate the impact” of acquisitions by the company. In the first quarter of 2019, when the company began reporting non-GAAP metrics, those adjustments allowed BlackBerry to post a slight earnings beat by counting revenue that wouldn’t be allowed under GAAP. While BlackBerry also reported GAAP numbers during the quarter, SEC rules dictate the company give GAAP numbers at least equal priority as non-GAAP numbers. In its response to the comment letter, BlackBerry said: InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips “… the Company did not view this adjustment as misleading. Further, if the Company did not [report non-GAAP figures] its results could be less useful to investors… However, as a result of the declining quantitative impact of these adjustments as they trend to zero due to the time elapsed since its acquisitions, the Company plans to discontinue its usage of [non-GAAP figures] beginning in its upcoming fiscal year.” BB stock was reporting non-GAAP figures as recently as December 2020, when it reported fiscal year 2021 third quarter results. Those results saw the company bottom line beat out the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3 cents. It’s worth noting that non-GAAP earnings per share of 2 cents were much higher than GAAP losses of 23 cents per share. BlackBerry is set to report Q4 and full year earnings for fiscal 2021 on March 30. Those results will still include non-GAAP figures alongside GAAP figures.

In the last reported quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 300%. It pulled off a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 406.3%, on average.

This Waterloo, Canada-based cybersecurity software and services company continues to invest in product development and go-to-market strategy to drive long-term sustainable growth. It is witnessing significant traction in the Spark business. BlackBerry is expected to have benefited from QNX design wins and cybersecurity partnerships. During the fiscal fourth quarter, the company expanded its partnership with Baidu. Per the alliance, Baidu’s high-definition maps will run on the QNX Neutrino Real-time Operating System.

Also, BlackBerry announced that its QNX Black Channel Communications Technology would be used in Motional’s next-generation driverless vehicles. It released QNX Hypervisor 2.2, the latest edition of its real-time embedded hypervisor product. BlackBerry and Amazon Web Services inked a global agreement to develop and market BlackBerry’s Intelligent Vehicle Data Platform, IVY.

The company made enhancements to its Radar H2 data-driven asset monitoring devices to help the world’s transportation businesses reduce costs and improve the utilization of their trailers, containers, chassis and other remote assets. These developments are likely to have had a positive impact on BlackBerry’s top line.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for adjusted earnings per share is pegged at 3 cents, which suggests a decline of 66.7% from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure. Our proven model doesn’t conclusively predict an earnings beat for BlackBerry this time around.

There were only 35 exits in 2020 which was 57% lower than the 5-year average (82 exits, 2015-2019). In addition to IPOs, other exits include 24 M&A deals totalling CAD $1B, and 6 secondary buy-out deals with CAD $2.7B invested in 2020. The largest exit in 2020 was Ontario-based waste management company GFL Environmental, listing on TSX in February with a market cap of CAD $7.7B backed by Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan and other investors. ""PE investors are moving forward cautiously amid the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and are being faced with a bombardment of new variables such as shifts to consumer preferences, digitization, government restrictions, and low-to-zero touch models,"" said Kim Furlong, Chief Executive Officer, Canadian Venture Capital and Private Equity Association. ""It is also interesting that amidst the economic turmoil that COVID-19 has created, the valuation market remains very hot. The valuation factor is what we will be watching most closely in 2021."" 2020 experienced an unprecedented rise in the number of debt financing deals, with 260 deals in 2020 compared to the 5-year average of 195 deals (2015-2019), as well as an increase in minority investments compared to the 5-year average. The rise in debt financing deals indicate a shift in investor risk during 2020 when the need for liquidity is heightened in portfolio companies. 2020 also saw an uptick in privatization deals returning to the peak levels experienced in 2017, potentially attributable to the trend of certain sectors opting to de-risk themselves from the volatility of public markets by going private:              ",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/agriculture-agri-food-canadas-youth-154100775.html
2021-03-23T08:56:00.000Z,Xinhua Silk Road: Changsha Economic and Technological Development Zone in C. China's Hunan unveils multiple measures to attract talents worldwide,"BEIJING, March 23, 2021 /CNW/ -- Changsha Economic and Technological Development Zone, located in the east of Changsha, capital of central China's Hunan Province, held the China (Hunan) Pilot Free Trade Zone International Talent Port Policy Promotion and Talent Exchange Event on March 18 in a bid to attract talents around the world. Zhang Qinghong, director of the management committee of Changsha Economic and Technological Development Zone, introduced a slew of measures for promoting the construction of an international talent pool. Each enterprise that is set up by overseas students or foreign talents in the zone will be granted up to 10 million yuan worth of project subsidy, and 900,000 yuan of rental subsidy or 1 million yuan of venue purchase subsidy. Overseas students and foreign talents that start businesses in the zone can stay in the apartment or international talent community for free, or enjoy a rental subsidy of up to 5,000 yuan per month. High-level talents will be given a housing subsidy ranging from 80,000 yuan to 2 million yuan. Meanwhile, the children of high-level talents attending private schools or international schools within the districts or counties will be given a one-time tuition subsidy of up to 90,000 yuan per person. Moreover, the part of personal income tax paid in the district that exceeds 15 percent will be fully subsidized. A salary award of up to 4 million yuan per year will be given to newly introduced overseas top talents. In addition, an exchange and internship base for foreign college students will be established, with each person given a one-time work subsidy of up to 6,000 yuan. The newly-evaluated ""Foreign Intellectual Achievement Demonstration Base"" will be given up to 500,000 yuan of one-time rewards. Zhang called on all talents to join hands with Changsha Economic Development Zone, share new opportunities and seek new development. Changsha Economic and Technological Development Zone, taking up 40 percent of the total area of the Hunan Pilot Free Trade Zone, focuses on the development of high-end equipment manufacturing, new generation information technology and biomedicine.

2021-03-18T12:56:12.000Z,"Telecom Stock Roundup: Nokia Inks Cloud-Based Deals, Qualcomm Buys NUVIA & More","The U.S. telecom stocks witnessed a relatively flat trajectory on an average over the past week as the Biden administration announced fresh restrictions against China-based telecommunications equipment manufacturer Huawei, putting domestic suppliers in a spot of bother. Extending tariff exclusions until Sep 30, 2021 on about 99 categories of medical products from China, including masks, X-ray tables and gloves to aid the fight against COVID-19, Washington meted out tough steps against Huawei, thereby offering it no respite from the change in regime. This created a sense of insecurity within the industry as it remained circumspect of the government’s future course of action.

Reinforcing a hard stance for export to the beleaguered firm, the administration amended some licenses for companies that supply raw materials to Huawei, putting in jeopardy certain existing contracts already in force. The amended terms make it rather impossible for the companies to supply items that can be used with 5G devices, even if the said items have nothing to do with 5G functioning. Simultaneously, the FCC has placed Huawei along with four other China-based telecom firms, namely ZTE, Hytera Communications, Hangzhou Hikvision Digital Technology, and Dahua Technology on the blacklist, deeming them threats to the national security. This, in turn, is likely to prohibit domestic firms from using their communications equipment or services. The FCC has also set the ball rolling to revoke the authorization of China Unicom Americas, Pacific Networks and its wholly owned subsidiary ComNet to provide U.S. telecommunications services. This follows a show-cause notice issued in April 2020 to show legitimate reasons as to why their licenses should not be revoked on grounds of national security threats.

As the political slugfest for 5G supremacy continued at the backdrop, a district judge removed Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi from a blacklist that barred U.S. companies from investing in it. Citing lack of substantial evidence about risks to national security, the judge suspended the investment ban against the firm. Meanwhile, despite several cyber threats and recent incidents of hacking, the Biden administration is not yet planning to set up government surveillance of the U.S. Internet as it remains mindful of the privacy and civil liberties implications that could arise. Instead, the government plans to focus on strict partnerships and improved information-sharing with the private-sector companies that already have broad visibility into the domestic Internet to thwart cyber-theft and data intrusion efforts.

2021-03-16T21:27:56.000Z,BlackBerry Patent Application For Autonomous Vehicle System Approved: What's Next?,"BlackBerry Ltd (NYSE: BB) was issued a patent Tuesday for “methods and systems for autonomous vehicle refueling.” What Happened: The Waterloo, Ontario-based technology company applied for the patent on Aug. 23, 2017, and it covers a signaling system for autonomous vehicles. The patent was granted through the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. How It Works: The system would interpret when an autonomous vehicle is in need of refueling, confirm when the vehicle is in proximity to a refueling station, signal an attendant to commence refueling, stop refueling at the vehicle's threshold level and repeat the signal if refueling didn’t take place. Why It Matters: The signaling system could be used for any type of autonomous vehicle, including those powered by gasoline, diesel or electric batteries. In the patent, BlackBerry predicted the rise of autonomous vehicles and looked to get ahead of the curve. “Autonomous vehicles are likely to become widely used in coming years. Such autonomous vehicles may be used for many purposes, including autonomous deliveries, autonomous taxicabs, vehicle sharing infrastructure in which the vehicle relocates itself between users, among other things,” BlackBerry wrote in the patent. BlackBerry appears to have considered every possible issue with a signaling system, including potential scheduling issues if more than one vehicle arrived for refueling at the same time, issues around how the fuel or power would be paid for and how the system would detect if the wrong fuel was being administered into the vehicle. See also: How to Buy BlackBerry (BB) Stock BlackBerry added that autonomous delivery vehicles, without passengers inside, may find cost-savings in using a refueling signal system as companies would not need to hire an employee to monitor and refuel the vehicles. What’s Next: BlackBerry’s patent marks another foray into the auto industry. The company has recently been making big moves to partner with electric vehicle makers and has snagged deals with Baidu Inc (NASDAQ: BIDU) and Motional, backed by Hyundai Motor Company GDR (OTC: HYMTF), for BlackBerry’s QNX system to be used in their electric vehicles.

2021-03-16T12:18:12.000Z,BlackBerry (BB) Unveils Security Solution for Enterprises,"BlackBerry Limited BB has introduced new critical event management (CEM) solution — BlackBerry Alert — to help commercial organizations respond to disruptive events.

The solution has been built on BlackBerry’s expertise in providing CEM solutions to the public sector with its AtHoc product line. It is available to customers, be it small businesses or large enterprises, as a software-as-a-service solution or a fully-managed service.

BlackBerry leverages artificial intelligence and machine learning to deliver innovative solutions in cybersecurity and data privacy solutions. Prior events have shown that the commercial CEM market needs differ from the public sector. In the commercial sector, the traditional method of managing critical events across multiple departments can result in delays.

BlackBerry Alert combines data across an organization to provide a seamless exchange of information to keep businesses running. It monitors multiple business systems and external data sources to raise warning flags. This allows businesses to start taking action to mitigate risks and minimize the impact.

In the present times, organizations require resilient and sustainable critical event management capabilities to protect its stakeholders from uncertainty. BlackBerry Alert can be integrated within business tools like Microsoft Teams and ServiceNow.

BlackBerry continues to invest in product development and go-to-market strategy to drive long-term sustainable growth. The company is capitalizing on the secular trends of securing and connecting endpoints. It enables Enterprise of Things by providing the technology that allows endpoints to trust one another, communicate securely and maintain privacy.

QNX design wins and cybersecurity partnerships bode well for BlackBerry. It is also witnessing significant traction in the Spark business. The company is a leader in endpoint security, endpoint management and embedded systems.

BlackBerry’s shares have gained 147% in the past six months compared with 26.4% growth of the industry. The company delivered a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 406.3%, on average.   ",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/blackberry-bb-unveils-security-solution-121812864.html

Designed to measure and manage the crucial elements of the employee experience, the Listen suite integrates with a robust rewards & recognition (R&R) solution to offer a flexible approach to feedback focused on action for today's workforce. Despite the COVID-19 pandemic dramatically changing what work looks like, the science behind employee engagement remains the same — engaged employees work harder, stay longer, recruit equally engaged colleagues, and generate more value for the organization and its customers. Employees who are not empowered to perform their best are more likely to leave their jobs. In the Achievers Workforce Institute's latest 2021 Engagement & Retention Report, it found that 52% of employees are actively seeking work this year — up from 35% in 2020. Grounded in workforce and data science, the Listen suite leverages employee feedback at each step of an employee's journey inside the organization to give senior leaders visibility into their organization's health, HR professionals the insight to flag problems and opportunities, and equips managers to take real-time action. Specifically, with the new Feedback module — a digital toolkit for educating, informing and making employees more knowledgeable about company business through surveys, forms, polls and quizzes — it reaches employees at their point of performance to create an environment where they feel they belong and heard. The complete Feedback toolkit includes: Surveys for measurement and feedback Polls to gather opinions and insight Quizzes with scoring to test knowledge Forms to capture data directly to Excel ""At Achievers, we're on a mission to change how the world works, and we know that work begins with engaging employees and acting on their feedback. Feeling heard is one of the ways associates know we value them and is a core tenet of belonging,"" says Michael Cohen, Chief Product Officer at Achievers. ""By expanding the Achievers Employee Experience platform with the Feedback capabilities, teams are equipped with the tools they need to create these inclusive environments, as well as capture the fluidity of engagement and drive action with fewer disconnected systems.""

2021-03-12T21:04:11.000Z,Blackberry Stock Will Likely Be Volatile Prior to Q4 Earnings,"Canadian enterprise software group Blackberry (NYSE:BB) has had a rollercoaster ride in recent weeks. BB stock finished 2020 at $6.63. Then, on Jan. 27, it hit a multi-year high of $28.77. By March, the share price was down to $8.82, but today BB rests at around $11.50. Source: Shutterstock This recent volatility in BB stock has, in part, been due to Reddit traders who have specifically been concentrating on small stocks with high short interest. In fact, because of that rapid movement in the shares, Blackberry was asked to comment on the situation back in January by the Investment Industry Regulatory Organization of Canada (IIROC). Blackberry generates a majority of its revenue from software sales to other companies as well as to governments. Once known for its phones, it now focuses on cybersecurity and data privacy. For instance, in 2019, the company acquired cybersecurity group Cylance, which mainly catered to banks. Through this acquisition, Blackberry has been able to offer enterprise software products that rely on artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning.

So, this article will take a look at what investors can expect from BB in the coming days. If you are not yet a shareholder, you should analyze the company’s metrics before committing any capital to the shares. And if you currently have paper profits, you might want to take some of that money off the table. Here’s why. Right now, cybersecurity is more important than ever. For example, recent metrics highlight that, “Global cybercrime is expected to inflict a total of $6 trillion USD in damages in 2021” and that “59% of buyers are likely to avoid companies that suffered from a cyberattack in the past year.” So, because of the increased digitalization we’ve seen and the “work from home” trend this past year, many cybersecurity stocks have seen stellar returns.

What Happened: Although both companies have been in business for years -- Palantir was founded in 2003, BlackBerry in 1984 — their proprietary technology has become increasingly sought after by numerous companies across many major sectors. The companies have a lot in common too. Each company's platforms have disrupted the technology space by changing the course of how other businesses operate. The companies they partner with plug their own technology into Palantir and BlackBerry’s platforms and together create systems that are not only user-friendly but also completely safe and secure, something both companies pride themselves on. Both companies also have a long history with the U.S. government. Through its wholly-owned subsidiary BlackBerry Government Solutions headquartered in Washington D.C., BlackBerry provides an end-to-end software stack that protects the data of nearly every federal department. More than 70% of all federal employees use devices that are protected by BlackBerry’s crisis communication solution. Similarly, Palantir, a company that has seemed shrouded in secrecy until this year, provides software used by the U.S. Intelligence Community and the Department of Defense for counterterrorism projects. Although never officially confirmed by the company, it is widely reported that Palantir’s data-mining software was used to locate Osama Bin Laden. Why It Matters: Recently more and more corporations, such as automakers, big tech companies and private organizations, have been jumping on board using BlackBerry and Palantir software. Both companies' software platforms can be used by a single company to assist in secure and safe data analytics, transfers and storage. The duo also holds partnerships with Amazon.com, Inc.

2021-03-11T14:07:02.000Z,"Telecom Stock Roundup: AT&T Updates Investors, BlackBerry's Smart Cabin & More","The U.S. telecom stocks mirrored the broader benchmark indices and witnessed an uptrend over the past week as the Congress gave the final approval to the nearly $1.9 trillion stimulus package to boost the industry. The package, which represents one of the largest federal aids since the Great Depression, will continue to provide federal jobless benefits and relief measures to small businesses that are struggling due to the pandemic. The industry was further buoyed by proposed funds for technology modernization programs that underscored the importance and urgency of strengthening U.S. cybersecurity capabilities amid various security breaches.

About $2 billion of the $1.9 trillion federal aid is earmarked for cybersecurity and technology modernization programs. Half of this proposed amount will be channeled into the Technology Modernization Fund that is likely to help the federal government launch new cyber and information technology programs, while about $650 million will support the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency to thwart cybersecurity threats. The government also intends to spend about $200 million for boosting human capital in order to support the federal Chief Information Security Officer and U.S. Digital Service. The political slugfest for 5G supremacy at the backdrop dovetailed with the administrative efforts to set guardrails and legislation to safeguard the interests of domestic firms and provided confidence to the industry with adequate funds for modernization efforts.

Meanwhile, China-based wireless carrier China Telecom, which was delisted from the NYSE, intends to launch a secondary offering in the Shanghai Stock Exchange to broaden its source of funds and improve its capital as it prepares for life beyond the United States. Notably, state-owned oil giant, China National Offshore Oil Corp became the latest firm to be pushed out of the NYSE following erstwhile President’s decoupling efforts. With President Biden not making any visible effort to reverse those policies as it continues with an internal review process, several other communist nation-backed firms lie in fray to get delisted. This, in turn, has prompted China to free its coffers to technology firms in order to accelerate their R&D efforts.

I'm just curious if you own any of these meme stocks that Jared was just talking about. And what might you tell investors who are either playing with these stocks right now or enticed to? CHRISTOPHER UHL: Well, Alexis, thanks for having me back on. Actually, the last time we spoke, I was in AMC and had gotten out of it and doubled my money in the meantime. But right now, no, I don't have anything on. I'm actually looking at the energy sector and the financial sector. Those two have been on a very hot streak lately. But I will say, I had a couple of people texting me this morning with their GameStop shares that they accidentally have had for a decade and wound up in this fortunate position. I said, you know what? Hang on for the ride. Nobody knows how high this is going to go. We saw a couple months ago the volatility that can be in there. But you know what? Hang on for the ride. At some point, it'll come back down, and maybe then will be the time to take profits. But in the meantime, who knows how high this could go? ALEXIS CHRISTOFOROUS: Wait, why would you want to take profits when it comes back down, Christopher? I mean, I would think if you got this stock as, like, a gift a decade ago or something because you were into video games and GameStop, you see the tremendous ride it's been on, maybe it does make sense. I mean, these people certainly aren't day trading. Maybe it does make sense for them to take those profits now. CHRISTOPHER UHL: You've got an excellent point. But we never know how high this is going to go. Especially with the momentum and the fuel behind this, I mean, this could hit $1,000. And maybe when it comes back down, I'm not talking about it comes back down to five or 10. I'm talking about when it retraces maybe 5% or 10% from its high. I certainly wouldn't want someone to watch this go up to 350 and then back down to 5 and have really nothing to show for it. That's what I mean. We're going to trend trade this as high and as far as we can.         ",https://finance.yahoo.com/video/investors-dip-two-sectors-amid-192813255.html
2021-03-10T14:44:23.000Z,Unusual Options Activity Insight: BlackBerry,"On Wednesday, shares of BlackBerry (NYSE:BB) saw unusual options activity. After the option alert, the stock price moved up to $10.46. Sentiment: BEARISH Option Type: SWEEP Trade Type: CALL Expiration Date: 2021-04-16 Strike Price: $11.00 Volume: 0 Open Interest: 10899 Three Indications Of Unusual Options Activity One way options market activity can be considered unusual is when volume is exceptionally higher than its historical average. The volume of options activity refers to the number of contracts traded over a given time period. The number of unsettled contracts that have been traded, but not yet closed, is called open interest. These contracts are not yet closed because a buyer has not purchased the contract, or a seller has not sold it. See also: How to Buy BlackBerry (BB) Stock Another sign of unusual activity is the trading of a contract with an expiration date in the distant future. Usually, additional time until a contract expires allows more opportunity for it to reach its strike price and grow its time value. Time value is important to consider because it represents the difference between the strike price and the value of the underlying asset. Contracts that are ""out of the money"" are also indicative of unusual options activity. ""Out of the money"" contracts occur when the underlying price is under the strike price on a call option, or above the strike price on a put option. These trades are made with the expectation that the value of the underlying asset is going to change dramatically in the future, and buyers and sellers will benefit from a greater profit margin. Understanding Sentiment Options are ""bullish"" when a call is purchased at/near ask price or a put is sold at/near bid price. Options are ""bearish"" when a call is sold at/near bid price or a put is bought at/near ask price. Although the activity is suggestive of these strategies, these observations are made without knowing the investor's true intentions when purchasing these options contracts. An observer cannot be sure if the bettor is playing the contract outright or if they're hedging a large underlying position in a common stock. For the latter case, the exposure a large investor has on their short position in common stock may be more meaningful than bullish options activity.

BlackBerry AtHoc, the first EMNS solution to achieve FedRAMP Authorization is now the first to support Derived Credentials for identity authentication on a mobile device. In addition, BlackBerry has added AWS GovCloud to its cloud infrastructure, making BlackBerry AtHoc services the most widely available EMNS solution to the Federal government. A recent report found that 67% of breaches are caused by credential theft and social engineering attacks that capitalized on moments in time like COVID-19. To protect Federal employees, the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) mandates all Federal departments use Derived Credentials for identity proofing on mobile devices. Support for Derived Credentials within the BlackBerry AtHoc mobile app will allow Federal customers to ensure authentication and authorization to sensitive data when using the app for instant messaging, sending or responding to notifications. ""For U.S. Federal government agencies where the stakes are high, they cannot afford a cybersecurity breach,"" said Dubhe Beinhorn, Vice President of BlackBerry AtHoc Federal Sales. ""The combination of securing the Federal mobile workforce using Derived Credentials along with implementing best-in-class security, protection, and compliance services in the FedRAMP-Azure and -AWS environments makes BlackBerry AtHoc the most secure solution for critical event management and emergency mass notification in the market."" BlackBerry is the only vendor that can provide FedRAMP-Authorized emergency mass notification system (EMNS) services to government customers across the two leading government-certified hosting environments. BlackBerry AtHoc achieved FedRAMP Authorization on Microsoft Azure Cloud in 2017 and has successfully completed the FedRAMP audit to add AWS GovCloud to its infrastructure. Running BlackBerry AtHoc simultaneously in both the Azure and AWS cloud environments helps to ensure service redundancy and prevent service disruption if one of the cloud environments experiences an outage.
