2021-06-08T17:31:25.000Z,GameStop stock sent higher by meme trading army ahead of earningsYahoo Finance,"The meme stock army is showing its support for the OG of the 2021 retail trading movement — GameStop (GME) — ahead of the company's earnings on Wednesday evening. Shares of GameStop rose as much as 6% to $292 in afternoon trading on Tuesday as fast-money traders positioned themselves prior to the earnings release. GameStop was among the top five most commented stocks on social media, according to data from social monitoring service HypeEquity. Talk on social media of call options on GameStop — or a bet on the stock rising in the short-term — outpaced chatter of put options by a five-to-one ratio.  HypeEquity data shows traders keen on pushing GameStop's stock above $300 before earnings hit the tape.  Over on SwaggyStocks, another social media tracking platform, GameStop's stock was the fourth most commented on ticker on Reddit's WallStreetBets page. Positive mentions on the stock outnumbered negative mentions by six times. It's clear meme traders continue to overlook the present fundamental state of GameStop (which is bad). Instead they appear to be staying true to large shareholder and soon-to-be chairman Ryan Cohen (aka Chewy co-founder) outlining some form of revitalization plan for the chain in 2021. Speaking to GameStop's fundamentals, here is what Wall Street expects from the retailer in the first quarter. Note that the Bloomberg compiled consensus estimates only reflect projections from three analysts. Most sell-side analysts have dropped coverage of GameStop given the heightened volatility of its stock during the meme army's uprising.  Net Sales: $1.17 billion, up 14.6% from a year ago Adjusted Operating Profits: loss of $67 million vs. a loss of $98.8 million a year ago Adjusted Diluted EPS: loss of 71 cents vs. loss of $1.61 a year ago One of those analysts that recently pulled coverage on GameStop owing to insane levels of volatility is Bank of America's Curtis Nagle. ""Non-fundamental factors are still driving GameStop shares,"" Nagle said in a research note to clients.

2021-06-08T15:59:58.000Z,Wendy's just became the first fast-food meme stock — but there is a catchYahoo Finance,"Beloved burger and Frosty chain Wendy's (WEN) has won the honor of being the first fast-food stock to get roped into the red-hot meme stock trade. Shares of Wendy's spiked 16% in early afternoon trading on Tuesday after a favorable mention by traders on Reddit. The Wendy's ticker page was the second most trafficked on the Yahoo Finance platform, behind other meme crowd favorite Clover Health (whose stock popped 55% out of nowhere). Wendy's stock outperformed the slight decline in meme stock darling AMC Entertainment and a 6% rise in the OG of meme trading, GameStop (which reports earnings on Wednesday).  ""We’re aware of the unusual trading activity this morning and we’re closely monitoring,"" a Wendy's spokesperson told Yahoo Finance.  There are at least two striking things with the out of left field move in Wendy's shares Tuesday.  First, only 4.64% of the company's outstanding shares are sold short, according to Yahoo Finance Plus data. That runs counter to the high short position stocks that have characterized this year's meme stock trade. In other words, Wall Street is in no way betting against the future of Wendy's, dissimilar to GameStop and AMC.  And that brings us to the second point. The reason why Wall Street doesn't hate Wendy's is that unlike other meme stocks, Wendy's is a fundamentally sound business that is growing.  Wendy's U.S. same-store sales in the first quarter surged 13.5%, powered by diners heading back out after getting their COVID-19 vaccine and trying the chain's new breakfast menu. Digital ordering and a push into more premium chicken sandwiches also lit a fire under first quarter sales. Wendy's same-store sales internationally rose 7.9%. The Dave Thomas creation almost beat out McDonald's U.S.'s 13.6% same-store sales increase in the quarter, the latter of which could be seen as a letdown considering it launched three new chicken sandwiches. Same-store sales for Burger King in the U.S. rose 6.6% in the quarter.

2021-06-08T10:04:12.000Z,Big updates on tap for the biggest stories in the market: Morning Brief,"This article first appeared in the Morning Brief. Get the Morning Brief sent directly to your inbox every Monday to Friday by 6:30 a.m. ET. Subscribe Tuesday, June 8, 2021 Yes, we know, it's already Tuesday.  But a really interesting week for economic data and corporate news is just getting underway.  Later this morning we'll kick off three straight days of data that will offer updates on the biggest debates happening in the market right now — the labor market recovery, inflation pressures, and meme stocks.  In a way, all of these arguments can be connected with something like: Are people making so much money trading meme stocks with their stimulus checks that they don't need to go back work? And so on and so forth.  But each of these debates can also get quite detached from what the latest data tell us is or is not going on. Labor, prices, and the social role of markets are financial as well as political questions. And they each attempt an answer at what we should do with our time and how we should be compensated for it.  Fortunately, the next three days offer us data, not opinions, on developments along each front. The philosophical debates can resume in a week.  Thursday morning's inflation reading for May is likely to be the biggest market mover.  The consumer price index for May is expected to rise 4.7% over last year, which would be the most since 2008. On a ""core"" basis, which strips out the more volatile cost of food and gas and is preferred by policymakers, prices are expected to rise 3.4%. This print would be the hottest annual core inflation reading since the early '90s.  As Yahoo Finance's Emily McCormick outlined in a preview all of this week's economic data, Wall Street economists see inflation as a ""secondary"" concern when compared to talk about the Fed pulling back on its bond purchase program. But as we wrote in the Morning Brief last month, investors seem to be growing impatient with the Fed's insistence that inflation pressures will be transitory. Impatience that grew after just one month of hotter-than-expected inflation. A second straight month of inflation beating expectations would only heighten this debate.

2021-06-08T20:17:13.000Z,Clover Health Roars to Record as Short Sellers Get Burned,"(Bloomberg) -- Clover Health Inc., a health insurer backed by venture capitalist Chamath Palihapitiya, was swept up in meme-stock mania on Tuesday, posting a second day of wild gains as retail investors banded together to punish short-sellers betting against the company. Clover rallied 86% to close at $22.15 in New York trading after briefly doubling intraday. The gains erased five months of losses in the stock -- which formed part of a broader selloff in Palihapitiya-backed companies -- in just two days. Trading volume in Clover was more than 29 times the three-month daily average on Tuesday, with a record 718 million shares changing hands. The sudden flurry of demand comes after retail traders realized that short-sellers had been swelling their bets against Clover, a move that left them vulnerable if the stock were to start rallying. The stock’s story -- like many retail plays -- has left behind fundamentals with shares trading above $20, that’s more than twice the average analyst estimate. On the Reddit forum WallStreetBets, chatter has built this week on the potential for a short-squeeze in the stock, following similar successful ploys on meme stocks including Workhorse Group Inc. and Richard Branson’s space exploration company Virgin Galactic Holdings Inc., which advanced 12% and 8.1%, respectively. Bearish bets in Clover have been steadily climbing since March and now stand at over $580 million or 44% of the public float, according to data from S3 Partners. Daytraders also touted the stock’s potential inclusion into the Russell indices -- a rebalancing of those benchmarks is expected toward the end of June.

The sharp gains, however, have caught the attention of regulators at the Securities and Exchange Commission. On Monday the agency said it is looking into signs of market manipulation given the ""volatility in certain stocks.""    The volatility has also made it challenging for analysts to cover, with two analysts in the past week dropping coverage of GameStop, the stock that was catapulted higher in January by retail investors.    Cinema operator AMC Entertainment Holdings, which almost doubled in value again last week, was last up 21.1% at $58.00 while BlackBlerry's U.S. listing climbed 15.0% to $15.94 and put it up 56% since the start of June. Canadian cannabis producer Tilray's U.S. listing, meanwhile, surged 7.1%.    ""AMC never ceases to amaze me. Just when I think that train is over, it jumps almost 10 points in the first 30 min of trading,"" one poster on Reddit wrote.    Shares of AMC are up more than 2,500% for the year to date as it has courted individual investors, while shares of video game retailer GameStop are up about 1,305% over the same time.    However some bearish investors retreated from bets against AMC on Friday as the stock fell 6.7% that day with short interest falling 74.5 million shares, or 14.9% of AMC's float by the end of trade Friday from 88.2 million on Thursday, according to S3 Partners.    Institutional investors are largely sitting on the sidelines as the meme-stock rally driven by individual investors continues.

2021-06-07T13:33:13.000Z,Surging meme stocks like AMC and GameStop send Russell 2000 skyrocketingYahoo Finance,"Meme stock mania has been mighty kind to the small-cap Russell 2000 Index after its reconstitution last June.  The total market capitalization of the Russell 2000 Index surged 84% from last year’s reconstitution (or the addition and subtraction of new companies to the index) to $3.5 trillion, FTSE Russell said in weekend tweet. This year alone, the Russell 2000 is up more than 16% compared to a 12% gain for the S&P 500. ""In 2020, overall capitalization for the U.S. equity market stayed fairly flat, decreasing by 1%. However, we’ve seen a surge in growth in the first half of 2021 with the total market cap in the Russell 1000 reaching $44.1 trillion. We have also seen a resurgence in market capitalizations of small cap companies in the Russell 2000 reflecting the overall bounce back of U.S. equity markets following the COVID-19 recession in early 2020,"" said FTSE Russell CEO Arne Staal. To be sure, the index has been powered by massive gains in popular stocks among a new army of retail trades such as AMC (AMC) and GameStop (GME).  AMC shares have gained more than 700% in one-year's time, giving the money-losing movie theater chain a whopping $25 billion market cap. As for struggling GameStop, its stock has exploded 4,900% over the past year — it now sports a lofty $17.6 billion market cap. Given each company's bulging market caps, they are likely to be removed from the Russell 1000. The index typically showcases companies with sub $5 billion market caps.  Currently, the smallest company in the Russell 2000 Index is Velocity Financial (VEL). It boasts a market cap of $257.1 million, an increase of 171.2% from $94.8 million in 2020.  FTSE Russell's changes to its various indexes will take place after U.S. stock markets close on June 25. The company points out the reconstitution will impact more than $10.6 trillion in investor assets benchmarked to, or invested in, products based on the Russell U.S. indexes.

2021-06-08T06:18:23.000Z,"How to Tell If AMC, GameStop Can Make the Russell 1000","(Bloomberg) -- The Russell Reconstitution is a big deal every year, but this time, potential changes for GameStop Corp. and AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. make it interesting for a broader swath of investors than normal. The annual reconstitution of Russell’s U.S. family of indexes accounts for market changes in the previous year, and it affects more than $10.6 trillion in investor assets benchmarked to, or invested in, products based on the Russell U.S. Indexes, according to its website. Trading volumes on U.S. exchanges also tend to be among the heaviest of the year around the event. Will AMC and GameStop be moved into the large-cap Russell 1000 from the small-cap Russell 2000? The key date was May 7. The reconstitution ranks and market cap breaks for the Russell Indexes are determined based on information available on rank day -- this year, May 7 -- according to Catherine Yoshimoto, FTSE Russell’s director of product management. An existing Russell 2000 index member would have had to have a total market cap exceeding $7.3 billion in order to move into the Russell 1000 index, she said. Going by that, AMC -- with a market cap of $4.28 billion on May 7 -- would fall short of inclusion, while GameStop and its $11.97 billion market cap would make it. As of Friday’s close, after big rallies in the last month, GameStop had a market capitalization of $18.4 billion. AMC’s is $24.6 billion. The reconstitution process is pretty formulaic: There’s a whole cottage industry of analysts who predict changes to the indexes in advance with high accuracy. A preliminary ranking is done by Russell on May 7. The first round of information was announced on Friday, with the preliminary list of additions and deletions from the Russell 3000 (that’s a combination of the Russell 1000 and Russell 2000). Here are key quotes from Friday’s press release: “The market capitalization breakpoint which separates companies in the U.S. large-cap Russell 1000 Index and companies in the U.S. small-cap Russell 2000 Index increased by 73% from $3.0 billion in 2020 to $5.2 billion for 2021.”“The closely-watched final index membership lists, with breakouts for the Russell 1000 Index, the Russell 2000 Index and the Russell Midcap Index, will be published on Monday, June 28 when the Russell Reconstitution takes effect and the newly reconstituted indexes begin to operate.”    ",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tell-whether-amc-gamestop-russell-120012129.html
2021-06-07T19:37:29.000Z,Meme Stock Bulls Take Back Control as Hedge Fund Battle RagesFX Empire,"After a wave of selling heading into the weekend, retail investors have wrestled back control of their favorite shorted stocks, including AMC Entertainment and GameStop. The stocks are off their highs of the day, and retail investors are convinced that something shady is going on. Short sellers are swinging back after losing USD 2.2 billion from AMC’s rally last week. There are theories of traders pulling out all the stops — including the illegal practice of naked shorting, which is currently trending on Twitter. Shares of AMC have galloped 16% today but still failed to cross the psychologically important USD 60 level, where the movie chain stock closed above on June 2 for the first time. While AMC might be off its peak, investors don’t have much to clamor about considering that the stock has skyrocketed more than 467% since early May. Fellow WallStreetBets stock GameStop is tacking on close to 11% in today’s session. The stock has gained more than 1,400% year-to-date for a market cap of USD 19.4 billion. GameStop investors have proven to be a loyal bunch as it hasn’t always been easy to hold. But those who have stuck around continue to be rewarded with more potential runway for gains. Ihor Dusaniwsky, managing director of predictive analytics at S3 Partners, revealed in a tweet that GMC and AMC each have a short squeeze risk score attached of 10 out of a possible 10. Meanwhile, the WallStreetBets crowd has taken over Twitter, with #nakedshorting trending on the social media site. To be clear, unlike regular shorting, which is legal, naked selling is not legal. It has to do with selling shares that have not been issued yet. Nonetheless, it still happens in the market. Naked shorting is how 140% of GameStop’s float can have short interest, as pointed out by Charles Payne on Fox Business. Christian, Smith & Jewell Law Firm Attorney Wes Christian said he blames the prime brokers that are custodying the assets as well as market makers for this behavior.

The S&P 500 rose 0.1% as of 2:38 p.m. Eastern. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 4 points, or less than 0.1%, to 34,634 and the Nasdaq rose 0.3%. Smaller company stocks outgained the broader market for the second day in a row, driving the Russell 2000 index 0.9% higher. A variety of companies that rely on direct consumer spending made solid gains. Domino’s Pizza rose 1.5% and Gap gained 3.2%. Industrial stocks also ticked higher. Energy companies rose along with the price of crude oil. Those gains were kept in check by falling health care and communication stocks. Banks recovered from an earlier slide but remained weighed down as bond yields, which they rely on to charge more lucrative interest rates on loans, slipped. The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 1.53% from 1.57% late Monday. The stock of Fastly, an internet cloud services provider, was 9.2% higher after the company said it had addressed an internal problem that caused dozens of websites around the globe to go down briefly, including the home page of Britain’s government and The New York Times. “We’re kind of stuck in the summer lull,” said Megan Horneman, director of portfolio strategy at Verdence Capital Advisors. “Week by week we’re going to go through periods where people are waiting for the latest economic data report.”      ",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/asian-shares-edge-lower-mixed-063347917.html

2021-06-07T20:23:41.000Z,AMC Shares Jump as New Meme-Stock Favorite Returns to Form,"(Bloomberg) -- AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. rose for the first day in three amid a broader advance in meme stocks and as regulators warned they are monitoring the frenzied trading in the group of shares for any signs of market manipulation. The stock closed 15% higher at $55 on Monday. Its shares more than doubled on the first two days of a holiday-shortened last week, but gave back some of those gains after insiders cashed in with a flurry of share sales. In a statement Monday, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said it’s monitoring markets for manipulation and other forms of misconduct amid the frenzied surge in so-called meme stocks. “We will act to protect retail investors if violations of federal securities laws are found,” the agency said. Read more: SEC Says It’s Scrutinizing Market Swings as Meme Stocks Surge On the brink of bankruptcy only a few months ago, AMC is now the darling of retail traders, with this year’s near-2,500% gain ranking as the most of any stock in the Russell 3000 Index. That’s despite calls from across Wall Street that the shares aren’t worth anywhere near where they currently trade. “The stock continues to not reflect fundamentals,” said Macquarie analyst Chad Beynon. “Retail traders are focusing on price and not what that translates to in terms of valuations,” he added. Still, the surge has enabled the company to sell equity and shore up its shaky balance sheet. AMC is building a “strategic war chest,” B Riley analyst Eric Wold wrote in a note.“In addition to our continued expectation that AMC could improve its balance sheet and future cash flows through debt repurchases/pay-downs, we could now see either acquisitions of smaller exhibitor chains or the takeover of leases from troubled chains,” he said. Company insiders have also started to take advantage of AMC’s swift run up in share price. At least six people affiliated with the firm sold more than $8 million of stock last week, according to regulatory filings with the SEC. Carla Chavarria, the company’s head of human resources, unloaded $2.5 million worth of shares, while Gary Locke, who is up for re-election to the board, sold more than 34,000 shares for $1.7 million.

2021-06-08T05:35:16.000Z,Meme Stocks Set To Extend Gains TuesdayInvesting.com,"By Dhirendra Tripathi Investing.com — Meme stocks, led by AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC), looked set to extend their gains for the second consecutive session rising 2%-5% in premarket Tuesday. The favorite of the Reddit gang, AMC, was up more than 4% while GameStop (NYSE:GME) and BlackBerry (NYSE:BB) gained approximately 2% and 3%, respectively. Meme stocks have defied the naysayers consistently over the last six months and while GameStop and Blackberry (TSX:BB) may be significantly off their year’s highs, it’s not been a flash in the pan. In the process, the stocks have made new highs several times and created wealth for many even as their books may not yet deserve those valuations. The companies are trying though. To the surprise of many, AMC has raised $1.24 billion in equity in three installments in less than a month, each at a different price, and proposes to sell 25 million more shares in 2022. GameStop, once a bankruptcy candidate, has reshuffled its top management as it tries to become a multichannel global retailer, retired part of its debt and created new facilities. Blackberry continues to strengthen its security software portfolio, have more cloud-based offerings and forge new partnerships.

2021-06-08T14:39:28.000Z,Biogen to start shipping Alzheimer's drug in about two weeksReuters,"(Reuters) - Biogen Inc said on Tuesday it expects to begin shipping its newly approved Alzheimer's drug Aduhelm in about two weeks and has prepared more than 900 healthcare centers for the intravenous infusion treatment. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Monday approved Aduhelm as the first treatment to target a likely underlying cause of Alzheimer's disease, sticky deposits of a protein called amyloid-beta. Biogen Chief Executive Officer Michel Vounatsos said on a call with analysts that the sites include clinical trial centers with currently confirmed amyloid-beta positive patients, as well as other locations with infrastructure to diagnose and treat patients. The company priced the drug at $56,000 per year and patients who are prescribed it need to undergo additional testing in the form of either a Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) test, or a PET scan to confirm the presence of amyloid-beta in the brain. Biogen CFO Michael McDonnell said on the call there are about one to two million Americans who have been diagnosed with mild dementia or cognitive impairment, who would be amyloid-beta positive if tested. The need for PET or CSF tests and the limited availability of specialists to oversee patients taking the drug could limit Aduhelm's use in these patients, McDonnell said. ""We believe the majority of diagnosed patients are not currently under the care of a specialist, and as a result we expect gradual uptake over time,"" he added. Revenue from Aduhelm could start ramping up in 2022 and beyond, but could be low in 2021 due to the need for sites to prepare to diagnose and treat patients, and the time that it will take to secure insurance coverage for the drug, McDonnell said.

2021-06-08T17:31:20.000Z,Editorial: This isn't how the FDA should OK Alzheimer's drugsLos Angeles Times Opinion,"The Food and Drug Administration didn’t just make a mistake by approving a new Alzheimer’s disease drug this week. It turned what is supposed to be an objective and science-based process on its head, giving the go-ahead to a drug for which there is far more evidence that it doesn’t work than evidence that it does. Patient advocates were, of course, avid to see drugmaker Biogen’s aducanumab come to market as a potential treatment for mild stages of the dementing disease, which so far has resisted efforts to combat it. Any hope, no matter how dim, is at least something in the eyes of families who watch their loved ones deteriorate mentally and physically for years before death takes them. The problem is that in this case, the hopes may be false ones. Aducanumab’s performance in two large clinical trials was so unimpressive that Biogen halted the studies. But then a collaborative effort by the FDA and Biogen teased out additional data from one of the studies that showed a small reduction in cognitive decline among a subset of subjects with mild Alzheimer’s who were given a higher dosage of the drug. And even then, the effects were modest. No previous trials examining this same therapeutic pathway — using an antibody to remove amyloid beta, a protein associated with the development of Alzheimer’s — succeeded in humans. It was odd and unsettling for the FDA to collaborate with the drugmaker applying for approval — so much so that the consumer advocacy group Public Citizen appealed to the Department of Health and Human Services to examine what they said represented an overly cozy relationship. The FDA then overruled its own advisory committee, which overwhelmingly recommended against approving the drug. To be clear, we are all for the federal government throwing its dollars and research might into solving the Alzheimer's puzzle. That should be a top priority, considering the severity of the disease and the greater toll it is expected to take as Baby Boomers age. But the agency's job is to ensure the safety and efficacy of drugs, not find ways to make them look better.         ",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/editorial-isnt-fda-ok-alzheimers-173120411.html
2021-06-07T18:37:01.000Z,Meme stocks ‘is a separate side show’: Strategist,"Art Hogan, National Chief Market Strategist, joins Yahoo Finance to discuss the meme stock frenzy, outlook on the market, and the global minimum tax deal. ALEXIS CHRISTOFOROUS: I want to continue our discussion on the markets now and bring in Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National. Art, good to see you. I want to stick with these meme stocks and the fact that a lot of investors might not even know they own these stocks because they're part of the Russell 2000 Small Cap Value Index. I'm talking about AMC and GameStop among them. What do regular investors who don't want to play the meme game need to know about what's going on in that space right now? ART HOGAN: Yeah, it's such a great question, Alexis. And I think that-- I think you and Jared hit it right in the last section, where he said it's its own animal. And you said it's a frenzy, right? So understand that that's what's going on right now. It's a separate sideshow. It is its own animal. It is a frenzy. It's a mania. But if you are along the Russell 2000, the IWM, part of the movement you've seen in the Russell 2000 has been because of companies like AMC and GameStop. And that will continue to be the case until they reconstitute that index. And actually, these names are going to get kicked out because they're too large. This is the function of if they're going to be put into the Russell 1,000, right? So that's what happens once a year, where it just so happens that that's happening this month. But in the near term, understand that if there's a handful of meme stocks that are rotating in and out of favor, it could have a potential move on the Russell 2000. But understand very small, the percentage that AMC or GameStop, back in the day when GameStop was the only game in town. In meme land, I think that that had a bit of a move on the Russell, too. But I think the Russell, too, really has been driven. Because it's domestically focused, focused on the US economy. Small cap tend to be cyclical. There's a lot of energy and financials in there. So I think there's a lot more fundamental drivers for the Russell 2000 right now versus that poll that has been the meme stock frenzy.

2021-06-08T14:36:15.000Z,Developing countries desperately need COVID vaccines: World Bank’s Ayhan KoseYahoo Finance Video,"Ayhan Kose, World Bank Prospects Group Director, joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss how COVID vaccine rollouts could impact developing countries and the global outlook for inflation. JULIE HYMAN: Let's get to the World Bank and its new prediction for what is going to happen in the global economy. 5.6% is the forecast for global growth this year. But as I mentioned, highly uneven is how the report characterizes it. Ayhan Kose is with us now. He's Director of the Prospects Group at the World Bank, as well as our Brian Cheung is joining us. Ayhan, as I look at this report, I have to wonder-- as we look at the unevenness of the recovery, as we look at the unevenness of vaccine distribution, for example, and how it's linked to economic recovery, how much is that 5.6% gain even at risk from the unevenness that we are going to see around the globe? AYHAN KOSE: Unevenness is the key word. And when you look at the global economy, the headline 5.6% is a record growth number. In fact, it is the fastest rate of growth after a global recession we have seen almost 80 years. Now, it is a tale of two recoveries. You have advanced economies. They are vaccinating rapidly and they are delivering phenomenal growth rates. Look at the US-- growth is going to be close to 7% this year, the fastest rate since the mid-'80s. China has done well in terms of vaccinating its population. It's going to grow 8.5%. And then you have other countries-- emerging market, developing economies other than China. Their growth rates are going to be around 4, 4.5%. Main reason is they are not vaccinating rapidly. They are still dealing with outbreaks. And of course, they provided much smaller amount of fiscal and monetary policy support measures. Going forward, it is going to be critical to vaccinate everywhere around the world, vaccinate everyone, and get the vaccination as quick as possible. BRIAN CHEUNG: Ayhan, it's Brian Cheung here. Great to speak with you. So given that point that there could be that kind of disparate recovery because of the access to vaccines, how should countries, beyond trying to improve vaccine distribution, which we heard David Malpass of the World Bank kind of talk about and advocate for at the G7 meeting, what beyond that should advanced nations like the United States, like the other G7 countries be doing to assist those low income countries that might have a slower recovery?

The stocks are off their highs of the day, and retail investors are convinced that something shady is going on.

GameStop investors have proven to be a loyal bunch as it hasn’t always been easy to hold. But those who have stuck around continue to be rewarded with more potential runway for gains. Ihor Dusaniwsky, managing director of predictive analytics at S3 Partners, revealed in a tweet that GMC and AMC each have a short squeeze risk score attached of 10 out of a possible 10.

Naked shorting is how 140% of GameStop’s float can have short interest, as pointed out by Charles Payne on Fox Business.

2021-06-08T17:31:25.000Z,GameStop stock sent higher by meme trading army ahead of earningsYahoo Finance,"The meme stock army is showing its support for the OG of the 2021 retail trading movement — GameStop (GME) — ahead of the company's earnings on Wednesday evening. Shares of GameStop rose as much as 6% to $292 in afternoon trading on Tuesday as fast-money traders positioned themselves prior to the earnings release. GameStop was among the top five most commented stocks on social media, according to data from social monitoring service HypeEquity. Talk on social media of call options on GameStop — or a bet on the stock rising in the short-term — outpaced chatter of put options by a five-to-one ratio.  HypeEquity data shows traders keen on pushing GameStop's stock above $300 before earnings hit the tape.  Over on SwaggyStocks, another social media tracking platform, GameStop's stock was the fourth most commented on ticker on Reddit's WallStreetBets page. Positive mentions on the stock outnumbered negative mentions by six times. It's clear meme traders continue to overlook the present fundamental state of GameStop (which is bad). Instead they appear to be staying true to large shareholder and soon-to-be chairman Ryan Cohen (aka Chewy co-founder) outlining some form of revitalization plan for the chain in 2021. Speaking to GameStop's fundamentals, here is what Wall Street expects from the retailer in the first quarter. Note that the Bloomberg compiled consensus estimates only reflect projections from three analysts. Most sell-side analysts have dropped coverage of GameStop given the heightened volatility of its stock during the meme army's uprising.  Net Sales: $1.17 billion, up 14.6% from a year ago Adjusted Operating Profits: loss of $67 million vs. a loss of $98.8 million a year ago Adjusted Diluted EPS: loss of 71 cents vs. loss of $1.61 a year ago One of those analysts that recently pulled coverage on GameStop owing to insane levels of volatility is Bank of America's Curtis Nagle.

2021-06-07T15:19:31.000Z,‘Gamma Squeezes’ Are In Play as Options Drive a Two-Faced Market,"(Bloomberg) -- A once-obscure but increasingly influential dynamic in the options market may explain why U.S. equities have been so two-faced lately. As meme mania rages, companies such as AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. are whipsawing traders like never before. Yet at index level stocks are the most placid in years, with the S&P 500 Index posting its sleepiest stretch since 2017. To the likes of Tallbacken strategist Michael Purves, it’s all about action in derivatives -- or in the case of the index, lack of action. Options dealers have been increasingly accused of moving stocks over the past year as they hedge their exposures. The thinking is that they’ve caused phenomenon like “gamma squeezes,” in which a dealer buys a rising stock to balance their exposure to contracts they have sold, only to drive prices further up and so be forced into buying even more. Read more: How Tech Options Juiced the U.S. Stock Market: QuickTake Such squeezes have been blamed for wild moves such as the tech-stock rally of 2020 and the December 2018 crash. Lately however, both options activity and pure-play bets on volatility for the S&P 500 have drifted lower. “The reduction of index volatility positions might help explain why some of the (index level) market behavior this year has come without some of the violent crazy whipsaws,” Purves wrote in a weekend note. “While there have been some abrupt moves, it doesn’t have the feel that came with some of the index gamma squeezes which could drive large swings up or down in the market.” Open interest in puts and calls on the S&P 500 is near the lowest it’s been since 2016, Purves points out. It’s a similar story for the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust, or SPY. That means some of the fuel for dealer hedging trades at the index level has disappeared. Cboe Volatility Index futures activity has also yet to recover to pre-Covid levels. Meanwhile, derivatives bets are booming again in single-name stocks like AMC as retail investors pile in.

The stock -- like GameStop Corp. before it -- has become a darling of retail traders. The movie-theater chain’s wild rise comes despite questionable fundamentals, prompting concerns among regulators that investors could be sitting on substantial losses if the stock plunges. The SEC has already said it’s investigating what happened with GameStop in January, with a focus on whether traders were using online message boards to dupe other investors into buying into the rally.

You can skip our detailed analysis of these fortunate short investors, and go directly to 5 Most Successful Short Sellers of All Time. Short selling has been getting a lot of attention amid the GameStop Corp. (NYSE: GME) saga that unfolded earlier this year and still continues to haunt various hedge funds, especially those who make money shorting stocks. Short selling has always been a risky investment strategy. According to a report by S3 Partners, shorts were down a whopping $245 billion in 2020. The firm's data shows that up till 2019, ten of the most shorted US companies had cost short sellers around $7.5 billion in market-to-market losses. Internet platforms and forums like Reddit and Robinhood have provided retail and general investors a way to unite and initiate ""short squeeze"" against institutional investors and major names who short companies. That's why when certain hedge funds started shorting AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc (NYSE: AMC) and GameStop Corp. (NYSE: GME), thousands of investors on Reddit started buying these stocks, resulting in millions of dollars in losses for funds like Gabriel Plotkin's Melvin Capital. But that doesn't mean shorting is always a bad strategy. Smart short sellers don't bet against companies randomly. They analyze securities, market trends and data. That's why in this article we will take a look at some of the most successful short sellers in the market's history. Some stocks you might be familiar with are some of the most shorted worldwide, showing how risky yet popular the process is. Up till 2019, Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA), AT&T Inc. (NYSE: T), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL), and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) were some of the most shorted stocks worldwide. This year, according to the Statista Research Department, PubMatic, Inc. (NASDAQ: PUBM) stands at the top of the most shorted stocks with a 50.82% share of float shorted. PubMatic, Inc. (NASDAQ: PUBM) is followed by Ontrak, Inc. (NASDAQ: OTRK) with a 45.56% share of float shorted, Blink Charging Co. (NASDAQ: BLNK) with a 37.82% share of float shorted, and Nikola Corporation (NASDAQ: NKLA) with a 36.81% share of float shorted.

Wendy’s jumped as much as 19% to notch a record as the fast-food restaurant operator gained traction on social media, including several touts on Reddit’s WallStreetBets forum.

Clover Health short interest as a percentage of float is about 42%, data from financial analytics firm S3 Partners show. “The power of the network effect of social media entices more people to get involved, so then they start broadening their horizons, looking for other names that have high short interest and things like that,” said Michael O’Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading. GameStop Corp., the original icon among retail traders, surged as much as 21% to the highest in almost three months ahead of quarterly earnings results, which are expected Wednesday.

He rates the stock sell with a $1 price target. “Management has been gifted an unforeseen opportunity from the recent wave of (fanatical) retail investor momentum, which has pushed the shares far above historical valuation levels,” Handler wrote. AMC company insiders have continued to take advantage of the stock’s run-up in price.

He is CEO and CIO of Tuttle Capital Management. Thanks so much for joining me today, Matthew. MATTHEW TUTTLE: Thank you for having me. ALISSA CORAM: So first of all, FOMO is definitely a catchy phrase out there right now, the fear of missing out. And I think many investors experience that. Sound investing is based on rules. But emotion is also a very big part of investing. So give us your take on how investors can actually use this FOMO to their advantage. MATTHEW TUTTLE: Yeah, so there's so much going on right now in markets, more than we've ever seen. So you've got the meme stocks. You've got the crypto. You've got the value stocks. So what FOMO is designed to do is allow investors to get access to all of those areas. And then going forward, whatever it happens to be the hot area, because it's going to change over time, but to do it in a smarter way. So we're going to have the GameStops. We're going to have the AMCs. We're going to have some of the Bitcoin things and the blockchain things.

2021-06-07T13:39:06.000Z,Investors buying meme stocks need to be ready for downside risks: strategist,"JJ Kinahan, TD Ameritrade Chief Market Strategist, joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss why more investors are buying meme stocks this year and the potential risks of buying GameStop and AMC Entertainment. MYLES UDLAND: OK, joining us now to talk about the state of the markets and how retail has been playing this market is JJ Kinahan. He's the Chief Market Strategist over at TD Ameritrade. So JJ, right before you came on, you heard us talking about what's happening with the meme names. You guys have your latest survey out of what your investors have moved in and out of the most. And a name that I did not see on that list was AMC. What have you seen on your side in some of these big names that really constitute kind of the core of the meme trade? JJ KINAHAN: Sure. So you know, if you think about it, AMC, GameStop, et cetera, for the last month wasn't necessarily as big a story. It became a bigger story right at the end of the month. What was interesting to me is when I looked at those stocks is that the week before Memorial-- so Memorial Day was a week ago today, it was last week on Tuesday that we really saw these explode. The week before, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday is when we actually saw our clients start to buy those names more. On Tuesday and Wednesday, our clients were more even in terms of their buying and selling of the stocks. So I thought that that part was really, really interesting overall. Obviously, the interest increased pretty significantly. Actually the one name that you didn't talk about but I know is part of the picture-- and just, you guys, it was a great discussion, had a lot to cover there-- was BlackBerry. BlackBerry was a name that in terms of percentage-wise, the volume picked up very significantly. Because GameStop and AMC continue to have this sort of interest all the time. And I thought it was interesting, you know, Julia was comparing some of this when we go down and people come in and buy it, to Tesla. And you know, and the stocks our clients purchased last month, Tesla was one of them, because they did sell off. And I think there was a little bit of a difference-- and it's one of the things you guys were talking about-- and that I also believe in talking to our clients that there's a belief that AMC is also a reopening play as much as a meme stock play, because people think that there is a hunger for movies and good movies, and people like the theater experience.

2021-06-07T19:37:29.000Z,Meme Stock Bulls Take Back Control as Hedge Fund Battle RagesFX Empire,"After a wave of selling heading into the weekend, retail investors have wrestled back control of their favorite shorted stocks, including AMC Entertainment and GameStop. The stocks are off their highs of the day, and retail investors are convinced that something shady is going on. Short sellers are swinging back after losing USD 2.2 billion from AMC’s rally last week. There are theories of traders pulling out all the stops — including the illegal practice of naked shorting, which is currently trending on Twitter. Shares of AMC have galloped 16% today but still failed to cross the psychologically important USD 60 level, where the movie chain stock closed above on June 2 for the first time. While AMC might be off its peak, investors don’t have much to clamor about considering that the stock has skyrocketed more than 467% since early May. Fellow WallStreetBets stock GameStop is tacking on close to 11% in today’s session. The stock has gained more than 1,400% year-to-date for a market cap of USD 19.4 billion. GameStop investors have proven to be a loyal bunch as it hasn’t always been easy to hold. But those who have stuck around continue to be rewarded with more potential runway for gains. Ihor Dusaniwsky, managing director of predictive analytics at S3 Partners, revealed in a tweet that GMC and AMC each have a short squeeze risk score attached of 10 out of a possible 10. Meanwhile, the WallStreetBets crowd has taken over Twitter, with #nakedshorting trending on the social media site. To be clear, unlike regular shorting, which is legal, naked selling is not legal. It has to do with selling shares that have not been issued yet. Nonetheless, it still happens in the market. Naked shorting is how 140% of GameStop’s float can have short interest, as pointed out by Charles Payne on Fox Business.

2021-06-07T13:33:13.000Z,Surging meme stocks like AMC and GameStop send Russell 2000 skyrocketing,"Meme stock mania has been mighty kind to the small-cap Russell 2000 Index after its reconstitution last June.  The total market capitalization of the Russell 2000 Index surged 84% from last year’s reconstitution (or the addition and subtraction of new companies to the index) to $3.5 trillion, FTSE Russell said in weekend tweet. This year alone, the Russell 2000 is up more than 16% compared to a 12% gain for the S&P 500. ""In 2020, overall capitalization for the U.S. equity market stayed fairly flat, decreasing by 1%. However, we’ve seen a surge in growth in the first half of 2021 with the total market cap in the Russell 1000 reaching $44.1 trillion. We have also seen a resurgence in market capitalizations of small cap companies in the Russell 2000 reflecting the overall bounce back of U.S. equity markets following the COVID-19 recession in early 2020,"" said FTSE Russell CEO Arne Staal. To be sure, the index has been powered by massive gains in popular stocks among a new army of retail trades such as AMC (AMC) and GameStop (GME).  AMC shares have gained more than 700% in one-year's time, giving the money-losing movie theater chain a whopping $25 billion market cap. As for struggling GameStop, its stock has exploded 4,900% over the past year — it now sports a lofty $17.6 billion market cap. Given each company's bulging market caps, they are likely to be removed from the Russell 1000. The index typically showcases companies with sub $5 billion market caps.  Currently, the smallest company in the Russell 2000 Index is Velocity Financial (VEL). It boasts a market cap of $257.1 million, an increase of 171.2% from $94.8 million in 2020.  FTSE Russell's changes to its various indexes will take place after U.S. stock markets close on June 25. The company points out the reconstitution will impact more than $10.6 trillion in investor assets benchmarked to, or invested in, products based on the Russell U.S. indexes.

2021-06-07T13:27:28.000Z,"Meme stock favorites start the week higher, GameStop earnings in focus","Yahoo Finance's Myles Udland, Julie Hyman and Brian Sozzi break down how meme stocks are faring ahead of this week's inflation data. JULIE HYMAN: Well, as we look ahead to that inflation data, as we saw last week, markets abhor a vacuum, a news vacuum. And so one of the things that leapt into the breach were meme stocks last week and AMC in particular, as we saw that stock rise-- I think 86% was the final tally when all was said and done, even with a dip late in the week. the shares are up another 4.5% here this morning. Myles, I'm sure you were doing some deep thinking on the meme stock front over the course of the weekend and whether we would continue to see a lot of this action. I don't know that we know what exactly sparked the rally that we saw last week or the renewed interest in it, but it doesn't feel like that it's necessarily going away. MYLES UDLAND: No, I think the more that I think about it, the more that we cover these meme stocks as, really, the most interesting sub-story within the market-- because all the conversation we were just having with Brian and the direction of the economy, that's heady stuff. That is where the base of the trajectory for all of this is really formed. But the activity with meme stocks underneath the surface and the fact that it has now come up in essentially the same form a couple of times within three months-- and yet, as we discussed with Jared last week, and I'm sure we'll talk about as we get through this week, the lack of spillover between what's happened in the meme names and how sentiment within the broader market is reflected, I think, to me is the most instructive part of this story right now. I know there were a few stories out from a variety of publications over the weekend about the index industry and how some of the rally in the meme names opens that up to distortions within the construction of the index. Because obviously, if you have a market-cap-weighted index or market-cap-weighted type fund, and AMC is now double the size that it was, quadruple the size that it was, it can move that index or fund around a little bit more. Of course, if you're talking about the Russell 2000 or you're talking about even a sector-level index, its weighting is going to be still in the fractions of percentage points.

2021-06-08T15:05:32.000Z,Why GameStop Stock Rallies Ahead Of The Earnings ReportFX Empire,"GameStop Video 08.06.21. Shares of GameStop gained strong upside momentum today as traders continued to push the stock higher ahead of the release of the company’s first quarter fiscal 2021 earnings report. The report will be issued on Wednesday, June 9, 2021, after the market close. Analysts expect that GameStop will report a loss of $0.83 per share. Earnings estimates for the full-year have actually trended down in recent months, and the market expects that GameStop will report a loss of $1.02 per share, which is projected to be followed by a loss of $0.59 per share in the next year. Typically, declining earnings estimates serve as a bearish catalyst for a stock, but GameStop’s valuation is completely detached from fundamentals so it remains to be seen whether traders will pay attention to the company’s financials when it releases its earnings report. The key question for the market right now is whether traders will use the earnings report as a catalyst to sell GameStop shares as the company is overvalued by any meaningful valuation metric. I’d note that Gamestop shares are moving higher at a very low trading volume compared to the volume that we have seen back in January – March when the stock was especially active. This means that there are few sellers of the stock, which allows buyers to push the company’s shares higher without using significant funds. In addition, the thin market is a true nightmare for short sellers who are trying to get out of their positions. At this point, it looks that dynamics of GameStop shares will depend on social media activity and short sellers’ problems rather than on the company’s earnings report. However, if the market decides to focus on GameStop’s earnings instead of the current short squeeze, the stock may gain significant downside momentum.

In the case of AMC, the hottest of them for now, traders may be trying to gauge where the company is headed. After raising $1.24 billion in equity in three installments in less than a month, each at a different price, it filed a preliminary proxy on Thursday seeking permission to sell 25 million more shares in 2022. It has been a roller-coaster for AMC traders who saw their stock double in just one session on Wednesday to hit a high of $83.63, only to fall in double digits on announcement of a new equity raise. The shares closed at $66.80 Friday. The pandemic has caused AMC's long-term debt levels to soar to $5.4 billion as of the first three months of this year from less than $2 billion in 2016. And it’s still losing money, with analysts expecting another $100 million to go over the next 12 months.

2021-06-07T18:17:49.000Z,Reddit’s WallStreetBets has a new favorite stockFortune,"GameStop and AMC are trading at levels no one could have imagined a year ago. Now, Reddit’s r/WallStreetBets community is looking for the next company whose stock is set to explode—and seems to have settled on Blackberry. The company behind the once iconic line of pagers and smartphones has seen its shares increase 137% year to date. That’s nothing compared to the 1,472% increase in GameStop and the 2,705% bump for AMC, but it’s the biggest surge the company has seen in two years. And, judging by chatter on r/WallStreetBets, interest is growing. A look at the subreddit Monday finds seven of the top 20 posts are dedicated solely to Blackberry. (Four others are focused on praising Clover Health Investments.) The stock is currently trading in the $15-$16 range, but the most enthusiastic investors are hoping to see it hit $50. “Don’t stop, BBelieving!!” encouraged user TehlorO. Meanwhile, user Substantial_Diver_34 showed a screenshot of what he says is his portfolio that is 100% committed to Blackberry, with over 6,400 shares. It was, at the time of the shot, down $14,000. The post is entitled “What have I done?” Other users gave nothing but encouragement. “I'll tell you what you've done: You've guaranteed your place amongst the millionares,” wrote kingandr3, while Firesice offered “You put in a winning bid...just needs a little time.” WSB bulls say Blackberry has grown from being a phone company to a cybersecurity firm that has deals with [hotlink]Amazon[/hotlink] and others and could be well positioned to take a position in the electric vehicle marketspace. Analysts aren’t as sure. Four firms currently have “Sell” ratings on the company, with only one suggesting investors buy. Of course, the r/WallStreetBets effect often defies the logic of analysts. AMC and [hotlink]GameStop[/hotlink] were floundering a year ago. Now, their stock prices and market caps have increased so much in recent months that they could join the Russell 1000 by the end of the month.

2021-06-08T06:57:46.000Z,U.S. Futures Mixed; Subdued Trading Ahead of Inflation DataInvesting.com,"By Peter Nurse    Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen opening mixed Tuesday in subdued trading, with investors cautious ahead of the release of key inflation data later in the week.  At 7:05 AM ET (1205 GMT), the Dow futures contract was down 70 points, or 0.2%, S&P 500 futures traded 2 points, or 0.1%, lower, while Nasdaq 100 futures climbed 25 points, or 0.2%. The blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 0.4% on Monday, the broad-based S&P 500 fell 0.1%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite outperformed, gaining 0.5%. This continued the tight trading ranges the major averages have endured this month to date, with investors seemingly reluctant to take major positions ahead of the release of the latest inflation numbers on Thursday, one of the few remaining major pieces of economic data ahead of the next Fed meeting on June 15-16. Economists are expecting the May CPI to rise 4.7% from a year earlier, according to Investing.com, a jump from April’s 4.2%, which was the fastest rise since 2008. Fed officials have called these inflation levels temporary that will ebb as special factors fade away, but analysts at Deutsche Bank have warned of the dangers if the central bank delays chooses inaction for too long. “The consequence of delay will be greater disruption of economic and financial activity than would be otherwise be the case when the Fed does finally act,” Deutsche Bank (DE:DBKGn) said, in a note. “In turn, this could create a significant recession and set off a chain of financial distress around the world, particularly in emerging markets.” In corporate news, Fastly (NYSE:FSLY) could be in the spotlight with the U.S. cloud computing services provider experiencing a technical issue. This could be behind the outage that a number of global news websites including the FT, New York Times and Bloomberg have suffered. Biogen (NASDAQ:BIIB) could also be in focus after the biotech’s stock gained almost 40% Monday on the back of the FDA approving its groundbreaking Alzheimer’s drug, while Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) announced the departure of a key executive late Monday.

Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock fell 0.5% after CEO Elon Musk announced, with a tweet, that the electric car manufacturer had pulled the planned production of its Model S Plaid Plus, which would have been Tesla’s longest-range vehicle and was also expected to be the priciest version of its flagship sedan, the Model S. Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) stocks will all be in focus after the G-7 group of the main developed countries in the world agreed to back a minimum global corporate tax rate of 15%. Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos also announced that he will be aboard the first human spaceflight by Blue Origin on July 20.  AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) stock rose 2.5%, GameStop (NYSE:GME) stock rose 1.2% and Blackberry (TSX:BB) stock rose 1.7%, as these so-called meme stocks continued last week’s positive tone, although in a less volatile manner. QTS Realty (NYSE:QTS) stock rose 21% after the Wall Street Journal reported that investment firm Blackstone Group (NYSE:BX), up 0.9%, will buy the data center operator for about $6.7 billion. U.S. Concrete (NASDAQ:USCR) stock rose over 27% after the company agreed to be acquired by Vulcan Materials (NYSE:VMC), down 0.7%, for $1.3 billion, with the deal set close in the second half of the year.

In the case of AMC, the hottest of them for now, traders may be trying to gauge where the company is headed. After raising $1.24 billion in equity in three installments in less than a month, each at a different price, it filed a preliminary proxy on Thursday seeking permission to sell 25 million more shares in 2022. It has been a roller-coaster for AMC traders who saw their stock double in just one session on Wednesday to hit a high of $83.63, only to fall in double digits on announcement of a new equity raise. The shares closed at $66.80 Friday. The pandemic has caused AMC's long-term debt levels to soar to $5.4 billion as of the first three months of this year from less than $2 billion in 2016. And it’s still losing money, with analysts expecting another $100 million to go over the next 12 months.

But for investors who want to ride the wave of what's trending, there's an ETF for that – the recently launched FOMO ETF. Matthew Tuttle, CEO and CIO of Tuttle Capital Management, explains how investors can use the ""fear of missing out"" to their advantage. [MUSIC PLAYING] ALISSA CORAM: Meme stocks like AMC and GameStop are once again getting a lot of attention. And though they can skyrocket in the short term, their volatility is a concern for investors looking for steady outperformance. But for those who want to ride the wave of what's trending, there's an ETF for that, the recently launched FOMO ETF. Joining me now to discuss is Matthew Tuttle. He is CEO and CIO of Tuttle Capital Management. Thanks so much for joining me today, Matthew. MATTHEW TUTTLE: Thank you for having me. ALISSA CORAM: So first of all, FOMO is definitely a catchy phrase out there right now, the fear of missing out. And I think many investors experience that. Sound investing is based on rules. But emotion is also a very big part of investing. So give us your take on how investors can actually use this FOMO to their advantage. MATTHEW TUTTLE: Yeah, so there's so much going on right now in markets, more than we've ever seen. So you've got the meme stocks. You've got the crypto. You've got the value stocks. So what FOMO is designed to do is allow investors to get access to all of those areas. And then going forward, whatever it happens to be the hot area, because it's going to change over time, but to do it in a smarter way. So we're going to have the GameStops. We're going to have the AMCs. We're going to have some of the Bitcoin things and the blockchain things. But we're going got weight those according to downside volatility so we're never going to have a situation where we're in a whole bunch of stuff in large amounts that gets you crushed.

2021-06-07T05:13:32.000Z,Exclusive-Some on Wall Street try options trade to bet against AMC without getting burned,"By Matt Scuffham and Saqib Iqbal Ahmed NEW YORK (Reuters) - Some Wall Street traders are betting against another massive rally in AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc and other ""meme"" stocks this week through a type of wager in the options market that would limit their losses should retail investors behind the run-up prove them wrong. A Reuters analysis of options data and interviews with market participants, including a Wall Street banker and a fund manager with $30 billion in assets, show that some institutional investors have ramped up complex options trades that let them bet the shares will fall. The so-called “bear put spread,” a common bearish options strategy, also limits profits. Its increased use now, which has not been previously reported, shows how Wall Street is looking for ways to profit off the unprecedented rise of retail trading but treading carefully after some high-profile funds got buffeted earlier this year. ""It's still dominated by these small retail trades for sure, but we are seeing sporadic big institutions tempted in just by the pricing,"" said Henry Schwartz, head of product intelligence at Cboe Global Markets Inc, referring to options trading in AMC. AMC has been at the center of a second wave of buying by retail investors who have been hyping the stock in forums such as Reddit's WallStreetBets, giving new life to the ""meme stock"" phenomenon that sent shares of video game retailer GameStop Corp up 1,600% in January. AMC’s stock rose just over 83% this past week. The stock has surged 2,160% this year, leaving traders with outright bets against it nursing paper losses of nearly $4 billion, according to the latest available data from S3 Partners. When a stock moves as much as AMC did last week - at times more than doubling in price in the course of a single trading session - it drives up the price of options. Typically moves of that magnitude don't persist for extended periods of time, and some professional traders are betting that will be the case this time, meaning the stock price will fall, market participants said.

2021-06-06T18:24:27.000Z,‘Conjuring’ Overtakes ‘Quiet Place’ to Lead Box Office,"(Bloomberg) -- AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. stock has been on a tear, but many of the seats at its movie theaters will be empty this weekend. Domestic box-office sales fell compared with last weekend, when ticket purchases hit a pandemic record. There are two new major releases, but neither is drawing the audience that the highly awaited “A Quiet Place Part II” brought to theaters last weekend. Ticket revenue may continue to slide until more blockbusters arrive later in the summer. The roller-coaster movie sales figures, which remain far below pre-pandemic levels, stand in stark contrast with the soaring valuation of the world’s largest theater chain. Though AMC’s sales have started to recover, the road ahead remains more challenging than legions of highly optimistic internet traders suggest. “The weekend after Memorial Day typically sees a drop at the box office, and we’re expecting a similar trend to play out,” said Shawn Robbins, chief analyst at Boxoffice Pro. “It will still be a few more weeks before theaters have a closer-to-normal supply of films.” “The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It,” a new release from AT&T Inc.’s Warner Bros., overtook “A Quiet Place Part II” to lead the weekend box office, generating $24 million sales in North America, according to researcher Comscore Inc. Existing customers of WarnerMedia’s HBO Max are able to watch “The Conjuring” at no extra cost. “A Quiet Place,” the horror film from ViacomCBS Inc.’s Paramount Pictures starring Emily Blunt, ranked No. 2 with $19.5 million in weekend sales, lower than the industry estimate of $22 million. Walt Disney Co.’s “Cruella,” which also debuted last weekend, came in third. “Cruella” costs Disney+ streaming subscribers an extra $30 to view at home -- which may well have made it more lucrative to Disney last weekend than “A Quiet Place Part II” was to ViacomCBS, according to Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Geetha Ranganathan. Based on an estimate from the tracking app Samba TV that 686,000 subscribers bought access to “Cruella,” and given the typical 50% split of box-office revenue with theater owners, Ranganathan figures the Disney prequel generated $34.1 million for the parent company, compared with about $28.5 million for “Quiet Place II.”          ",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amc-rally-contrasts-ho-hum-171855144.html
2021-06-07T23:40:04.000Z,The Conjuring 3: Are Jessica and Katie Based on Real People? Here's the DealPOPSUGAR,"As its title suggests, The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It (aka The Conjuring 3) deals with the real 1981 case involving Arne Cheyenne Johnson, a young man who claimed that demonic possession caused him to kill his landlord. The movie connects Johnson's case with that of two girls named Katie Lincoln and Jessica Louise Strong as Ed and Lorraine Warren search for clues relevant to Johnson's investigation. While very creepy, the story of Katie and Jessica isn't grounded in reality - they're both included in the movie to drive the narrative forward. In real life, the Warrens first met Johnson when his girlfriend's brother, David Glatzel, started showing signs of demonic possession. Eventually, the evil spirits supposedly came into Johnson himself. In the movie version of the events, the Warrens take it upon themselves to investigate Johnson's case after he stabs his landlord Bruno Sauls 22 times. While poking around leads, they come across the brutal murder of Katie Lincoln, a young girl who was stabbed 22 times. When the Warrens hop onto the case, police are still trying to locate her best friend Jessica. Inside Jessica's home in Danvers, homicide detectives find a witch's totem similar to the one Lorraine discovers beneath the Glatzel home, the artifact Father Kastner claims is set up by an occultist. In a vision, Lorraine sees how Katie's friend Jessica murdered Katie before jumping off a cliff. Touching Jessica's corpse, she gets a feel for where the occultist is operating. While they add layers to the Johnson case, Katie and Jessica aren't real, and neither is the occultist. Their appearances give the movie's plot structure and portray the Warrens as the protagonists in the story. The actual Warrens did indeed assist with managing David Glatzel's supposed demonic possession, but their involvement wasn't always welcomed by the Glatzel family. Lorraine Warren later helped Gerald Brittle write The Devil in Connecticut, a book that unpacks the ""Devil Made Me Do It"" case. Johnson and Debbie Glatzel have backed up the Warrens, but David and his brother Carl have asserted that the demonic-possession claim was a hoax exploiting David's mental illness. Suffice to say, The Conjuring 3 takes a lot of creative liberties despite being rooted in reality.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/while-conjuring-3-bases-plot-203259610.html

Not long after moving into the estate, creepy occurrences start unfolding in the house, including birds flying into their window and their dog dying. Their daughter Christine also sees a spirit that wants the family dead. Inevitably, the Perrons get in touch with Ed and Lorraine Warren, who are just fresh off the Annabelle doll case. The Warrens pin down the source of the haunting: the Perron house once belonged to a witch named Bathsheba Sherman, who sacrificed her child to the devil and killed herself about a century before the Perrons moved in. By the end of the movie, Ed successfully exorcises Bathsheba from Carolyn - we're not surprised to see her family pay him a kind gesture! The Conjuring and its sequels are all loosely based on investigations conducted by the Warrens. The Perron family is real, and they did indeed settle into an estate that they believed was haunted by a spirit named Bathsheba. One daughter, Andrea Perron, even wrote House of Darkness: House of Light, a book about her family's experience with the haunting. And yes, Bathsheba Sherman was also a real person from the 19th century. Locals believed that she was a witch after an infant died under her care, but she was never formally accused or prosecuted for any witchcraft or murder. Spookily enough, her grave actually still stands in Harrisville today.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ok-conjuring-devil-made-see-180755745.html

2021-06-07T07:04:09.000Z,"AMC, GameStop, Blackberry Poised For A Quiet StartInvesting.com","By Dhirendra Tripathi Investing.com — Meme stocks such as AMC (NYSE:AMC), GameStop (NYSE:GME) and BlackBerry (NYSE:BB) were all up 2%-2.5% in Monday’s premarket, pointing to a relatively subdued start to the week for investors accustomed to double digit gains. In the case of AMC, the hottest of them for now, traders may be trying to gauge where the company is headed. After raising $1.24 billion in equity in three installments in less than a month, each at a different price, it filed a preliminary proxy on Thursday seeking permission to sell 25 million more shares in 2022. It has been a roller-coaster for AMC traders who saw their stock double in just one session on Wednesday to hit a high of $83.63, only to fall in double digits on announcement of a new equity raise. The shares closed at $66.80 Friday. The pandemic has caused AMC's long-term debt levels to soar to $5.4 billion as of the first three months of this year from less than $2 billion in 2016. And it’s still losing money, with analysts expecting another $100 million to go over the next 12 months.

Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) stocks will all be in focus after the G-7 group of the main developed countries in the world agreed to back a minimum global corporate tax rate of 15%.

2021-06-07T18:17:49.000Z,Reddit’s WallStreetBets has a new favorite stockFortune,"GameStop and AMC are trading at levels no one could have imagined a year ago. Now, Reddit’s r/WallStreetBets community is looking for the next company whose stock is set to explode—and seems to have settled on Blackberry. The company behind the once iconic line of pagers and smartphones has seen its shares increase 137% year to date. That’s nothing compared to the 1,472% increase in GameStop and the 2,705% bump for AMC, but it’s the biggest surge the company has seen in two years. And, judging by chatter on r/WallStreetBets, interest is growing. A look at the subreddit Monday finds seven of the top 20 posts are dedicated solely to Blackberry. (Four others are focused on praising Clover Health Investments.) The stock is currently trading in the $15-$16 range, but the most enthusiastic investors are hoping to see it hit $50. “Don’t stop, BBelieving!!” encouraged user TehlorO. Meanwhile, user Substantial_Diver_34 showed a screenshot of what he says is his portfolio that is 100% committed to Blackberry, with over 6,400 shares. It was, at the time of the shot, down $14,000. The post is entitled “What have I done?” Other users gave nothing but encouragement. “I'll tell you what you've done: You've guaranteed your place amongst the millionares,” wrote kingandr3, while Firesice offered “You put in a winning bid...just needs a little time.” WSB bulls say Blackberry has grown from being a phone company to a cybersecurity firm that has deals with [hotlink]Amazon[/hotlink] and others and could be well positioned to take a position in the electric vehicle marketspace. Analysts aren’t as sure. Four firms currently have “Sell” ratings on the company, with only one suggesting investors buy. Of course, the r/WallStreetBets effect often defies the logic of analysts. AMC and [hotlink]GameStop[/hotlink] were floundering a year ago. Now, their stock prices and market caps have increased so much in recent months that they could join the Russell 1000 by the end of the month.

The volume of shares traded on Pakistan Stock Exchange have increased 7x over the past 18 months driven by an increase in retail trading. Karachi, Pakistan --News Direct-- Stockwood Strategy Leading Pakistani fintech stock trading app KTrade today announced it has raised $4.5m in a funding round from a range of global investors and institutions led by Hong Kong-based TTB Partners, and HOF Capital from New York. German fintech investor Christian Angermayer, the Managing Partner of German bank Berenberg David Mortlock, and leading Pakistani business families also participated in the round. KTrade is the fintech retail trading app created by KASB Securities, the leading stock brokerage in Pakistan. KTrade provides easy access to financial markets for retail investors much like its global peers such as XP in Brazil, Zerodha and Groww in India, Tiger in China, Flatex in Germany and Robinhood in the US. Since launching in 2019, KTrade has over 200,000 users and aims to reach 10 million Pakistani’s at home and abroad by 2023 to invest in stocks, bonds, commodities and mutual funds through its mobile platform. The Karachi Stock Exchange Index (KSE100) has rallied by 19% per annum over the past 20 years despite regular market cycles. The volumes have increased by 7x over the last 18 months driven by regulatory reforms and increase in retail investor participation. Retail investors now account for over 65% of overall trading volume compared to around 45% 24 months ago. KTrade aims to provide users quick and easy accessibility to this investment opportunity. Ali Farid led the creation of KTrade. He was previously the CFO of UK listed fintech company SafeCharge (acquired by Nuvei) and a Partner at Autonomous Research (acquired by Alliance Bernstein) in London. Ali is a Rhodes Scholar and has been a top ranked Technology Analyst in Europe since 2013. Ali Farid, Co-founder of KTrade commented: “People in Pakistan have traditionally turned to gold or real estate when they consider investment options. However, as the regulatory approach, authority and credibility of the Karachi Stock Exchange has grown, more people are getting comfortable with stock market investing. This is an exciting trend but accessibility to these markets remains a hurdle for millions. KTrade will enable this mobile-first population to participate in the investment opportunity. By connecting these people to companies we can drive capital trapped in unproductive assets into the formal economy which would eventually drive a virtuous cycle of economic growth and higher investments”.

2021-06-07T19:37:29.000Z,Meme Stock Bulls Take Back Control as Hedge Fund Battle RagesFX Empire,"After a wave of selling heading into the weekend, retail investors have wrestled back control of their favorite shorted stocks, including AMC Entertainment and GameStop. The stocks are off their highs of the day, and retail investors are convinced that something shady is going on. Short sellers are swinging back after losing USD 2.2 billion from AMC’s rally last week. There are theories of traders pulling out all the stops — including the illegal practice of naked shorting, which is currently trending on Twitter. Shares of AMC have galloped 16% today but still failed to cross the psychologically important USD 60 level, where the movie chain stock closed above on June 2 for the first time. While AMC might be off its peak, investors don’t have much to clamor about considering that the stock has skyrocketed more than 467% since early May. Fellow WallStreetBets stock GameStop is tacking on close to 11% in today’s session. The stock has gained more than 1,400% year-to-date for a market cap of USD 19.4 billion. GameStop investors have proven to be a loyal bunch as it hasn’t always been easy to hold. But those who have stuck around continue to be rewarded with more potential runway for gains. Ihor Dusaniwsky, managing director of predictive analytics at S3 Partners, revealed in a tweet that GMC and AMC each have a short squeeze risk score attached of 10 out of a possible 10. Meanwhile, the WallStreetBets crowd has taken over Twitter, with #nakedshorting trending on the social media site. To be clear, unlike regular shorting, which is legal, naked selling is not legal. It has to do with selling shares that have not been issued yet. Nonetheless, it still happens in the market. Naked shorting is how 140% of GameStop’s float can have short interest, as pointed out by Charles Payne on Fox Business. Christian, Smith & Jewell Law Firm Attorney Wes Christian said he blames the prime brokers that are custodying the assets as well as market makers for this behavior.

The sharp gains, however, have caught the attention of regulators at the Securities and Exchange Commission. On Monday the agency said it is looking into signs of market manipulation given the ""volatility in certain stocks.""    The volatility has also made it challenging for analysts to cover, with two analysts in the past week dropping coverage of GameStop, the stock that was catapulted higher in January by retail investors.    Cinema operator AMC Entertainment Holdings, which almost doubled in value again last week, was last up 21.1% at $58.00 while BlackBlerry's U.S. listing climbed 15.0% to $15.94 and put it up 56% since the start of June. Canadian cannabis producer Tilray's U.S. listing, meanwhile, surged 7.1%.    ""AMC never ceases to amaze me. Just when I think that train is over, it jumps almost 10 points in the first 30 min of trading,"" one poster on Reddit wrote.    Shares of AMC are up more than 2,500% for the year to date as it has courted individual investors, while shares of video game retailer GameStop are up about 1,305% over the same time.    However some bearish investors retreated from bets against AMC on Friday as the stock fell 6.7% that day with short interest falling 74.5 million shares, or 14.9% of AMC's float by the end of trade Friday from 88.2 million on Thursday, according to S3 Partners.

2021-06-06T06:59:18.000Z,Top 5 Things to Watch in Markets in the Week Ahead,"By Noreen Burke Investing.com -- Investors trying to gauge the inflation threat will keep a close eye on Thursday's U.S. consumer price data, amid concerns that rising inflation could prompt the Federal Reserve to begin pulling back on stimulus. Meme stocks look likely to continue to grip investors’ attention after a wild ride last week. Markets will also be monitoring the progress of President Joe Biden's proposed $1.7 trillion infrastructure plan, which has already boosted the industrials and materials sectors this year. The European Central Bank is to meet on Thursday and may discuss tapering stimulus. The UK is to release monthly GDP figures amid growing doubts about pushing ahead with the final step of the government’s reopening plan. Here’s what you need to know to start your week. Inflation threat All eyes will be on the latest CPI data on Thursday, after a much stronger than expected inflation number sparked a selloff last month, as many worried rising price pressures could force the Fed to begin unwinding stimulus soon. Friday’s jobs report indicated that while jobs growth picked up from the previous month wage growth also accelerated. This could bolster the argument that higher inflation may persist rather than being transitory, as is currently viewed by the Fed. The inflation reading is one of the last major pieces of economic data ahead of the next Fed meeting on June 15-16 and Fed officials will be in their traditional blackout period during the coming week ahead of that meeting. The economic calendar also features Thursday’s figures on initial jobless claims, which fell below 400,000 in last week’s release for the first time since the start of the pandemic. Meme stock frenzy The wild ride for meme stocks looks set to continue, after AMC (NYSE:AMC) shares ended last week with gains of more than 80% despite falling more than 6% on Friday. AMC has been at the center of a fresh wave of buying by retail investors who hyped the stock in forums such as Reddit’s WallStreetBets, breathing new life into a phenomenon that began with January’s more than 1,600% gain in GameStop (NYSE:GME).

2021-06-05T20:00:00.000Z,AMC Drama Is Exposing Risks in $11 Trillion World of Indexing,"(Bloomberg) -- Index funds are supposed to cut out the human-driven craziness that periodically infects markets, but the recent meme-stock fever proved the $11 trillion industry is far from immune. The remarkable surge in shares of AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. and a handful of other stocks is showing up in multiple exchange-traded funds, skewing portfolios, altering risk profiles and exerting outsized influence on prices. Take the $68 billion iShares Russell 2000 ETF (ticker IWM). In the past week through Thursday, AMC powered 70% of the product’s advance. The stock was responsible for less than a 10th of the fund’s return in the previous week. It’s a timely reminder that even diversified funds on autopilot remain subject to the whims and eccentricities that frequently lash markets out of nowhere. “For index investing, the appeal is that human decision-making, human emotions are taken out of it,” said Tom Essaye, a former Merrill Lynch trader who founded “the Sevens Report” newsletter. “That works all well and good until a stock that is supposed to be 50 basis points of the fund now becomes 6%.” The AMC effect can be seen across a range of funds. Alongside IWM, the $17.5 billion iShares Russell 2000 Value ETF (IWN) and $72 billion iShares Core S&P Small-Cap ETF (IJR) have also seen the stock’s influence climb. A similar phenomenon took place in January, when GameStop Corp. at one point surged more than 1,600%. Shares of the video-game retailer also rallied alongside AMC in the past week. The two companies are among a handful of shares dubbed meme stocks that are enjoying rapid, social-media fueled gains. “Once the rules have been drawn up in the land of indexing, once the play has been called in the huddle, you don’t have that discretion,” said Ben Johnson, Morningstar’s global director of ETF research. “You take whatever the market is going to give you and execute the plays.” Read more: Robinhood, Meme Stocks and Investing as a Game: QuickTake                         ",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amc-drama-exposing-risks-11-200000059.html

2021-06-05T05:31:50.000Z,Russell Reshuffle May Spell Trouble for Highflying Meme Stocks,"(Bloomberg) -- The upcoming Russell Indexes reshuffle could pose a problem for the likes of AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. and GameStop Corp. FTSE Russell’s annual Reconstitution event, which moves stocks around in its U.S. indexes based on their updated market cap and other characteristics, is set to call attention once again to the rise in so-called meme stocks that have been favorites of the retail-trading crowd. AMC is up more than 2,100% this year and GameStop over 1,200% -- with commensurate increases to their weighting in the Russell 2000 small-cap stock index. The two together now make up more than 1.1% of that gauge. But their enlarged market caps, with AMC at $24.6 billion and GameStop at $18.4 billion, put them squarely in line for a move to the Russell 1000 index of the biggest American companies. “The graduation of these high-fliers could be the beginning of the end of their epic run,” Wells Fargo analysts Christopher Harvey, Gary Liebowitz and Anna Han wrote in a note Friday. While there may be some buying beforehand from small-cap portfolio managers who are underweight those companies, that is likely to change for the stocks as the reconstitution takes effect, according to the analysts. “Once they graduate, their index representation drops (i.e., less impactful),” and portfolio mangers will have another year to wait for a shakeout on the stock prices, they said. AMC and GameStop have taken investors on a wild ride this year as they became darlings of retail traders. However, the stock action has boosted their prices well past where traditional Wall Street estimates would have put them. AMC is more than 800% above the average forecast of analysts covering the stock tracked by Bloomberg, the most for any U.S. stock with a market cap over $1 billion. The company is planning additional share issuance, and numerous insiders have cashed in on the stock’s runup. GameStop’s closing price Friday of $248.36 leaves its average 12-month target price of $55.80 in the dust.   ",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/russell-reshuffle-may-spell-trouble-053150145.html

2021-06-04T23:10:12.000Z,AMC Executives Take Home Millions by Cashing In on Share Surge,"(Bloomberg) -- AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. executives and directors sold $8 million in shares of the theater chain Thursday, cashing in on the soaring price of the most-popular meme stock. Two board members and four executives sold at near record prices, following an eye-popping surge in the stock this week, regulatory filings on Friday showed. Among them were Gary Locke, a former Chinese ambassador who is up for re-election to the board at the company’s July 29 annual general meeting, and Carla Chavarria, the company’s head of human resources. Among the six people who sold, Chavarria reported the highest proceeds -- $2.53 million after selling more than 40,000 shares at $62.67. The stock made an all-time high of $72.62 a day earlier. Others who sold include John McDonald, executive vice president of U.S. operations; Daniel Ellis, senior vice president of development; Elizabeth Frank, chief content officer; and board member Anthony Saich. AMC has been in the spotlight all week, with internet day traders urging their peers to pump up the share price and send a message to Wall Street traders who have bet the stock will fall. While they’ve caused some pain to so-called short sellers, the lofty prices have also enriched hedge funds and rewarded company executives. They’ve even added to the wealth of the two sons of AMC Chief Executive Officer Adam Aron. Aron himself has repeatedly said that he hasn’t sold any of his shares, including in an interview on YouTube Thursday, and has tied his fortunes to the success of the company. AMC raised more than $800 million this week selling new shares. Shares of AMC fell as much as 13% to $41.50 in extended trading after the filings were made. They gained 83% for the week through the Friday close in New York.

2021-06-07T19:37:29.000Z,Meme Stock Bulls Take Back Control as Hedge Fund Battle RagesFX Empire,"After a wave of selling heading into the weekend, retail investors have wrestled back control of their favorite shorted stocks, including AMC Entertainment and GameStop. The stocks are off their highs of the day, and retail investors are convinced that something shady is going on. Short sellers are swinging back after losing USD 2.2 billion from AMC’s rally last week. There are theories of traders pulling out all the stops — including the illegal practice of naked shorting, which is currently trending on Twitter. Shares of AMC have galloped 16% today but still failed to cross the psychologically important USD 60 level, where the movie chain stock closed above on June 2 for the first time. While AMC might be off its peak, investors don’t have much to clamor about considering that the stock has skyrocketed more than 467% since early May. Fellow WallStreetBets stock GameStop is tacking on close to 11% in today’s session. The stock has gained more than 1,400% year-to-date for a market cap of USD 19.4 billion. GameStop investors have proven to be a loyal bunch as it hasn’t always been easy to hold. But those who have stuck around continue to be rewarded with more potential runway for gains. Ihor Dusaniwsky, managing director of predictive analytics at S3 Partners, revealed in a tweet that GMC and AMC each have a short squeeze risk score attached of 10 out of a possible 10. Meanwhile, the WallStreetBets crowd has taken over Twitter, with #nakedshorting trending on the social media site. To be clear, unlike regular shorting, which is legal, naked selling is not legal. It has to do with selling shares that have not been issued yet. Nonetheless, it still happens in the market. Naked shorting is how 140% of GameStop’s float can have short interest, as pointed out by Charles Payne on Fox Business. Christian, Smith & Jewell Law Firm Attorney Wes Christian said he blames the prime brokers that are custodying the assets as well as market makers for this behavior.

2021-06-04T21:06:19.000Z,Wall Street Reins In Hedge Funds’ Short Bets on Meme Stocks,"(Bloomberg) -- Wall Street’s top brokers are quietly tightening their rules for who can bet against retail traders’ most-popular meme stocks. Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Bank of America Corp., Citigroup Inc. and Jefferies Financial Group Inc. are among firms that have adjusted their risk controls at prime-brokerage operations, according to people familiar with the moves. The banks are trying to protect themselves against fallout from extreme surges and dips that have characterized trading in companies including AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc., MicroVision Inc. and GameStop Corp. The changes mean some hedge funds and other institutional investors now face higher collateral requirements or are limited from shorting certain stocks, the people said, asking not to be identified discussing internal policy decisions. “Until further notice, Jefferies Prime Brokerage will no longer offer custody on naked options” in GameStop, AMC and MicroVision, the firm said in a memo to clients seen by Bloomberg News. Naked options allow investors to short a stock without owning the underlying securities. Jefferies, which told clients that other stocks may be added to the list, will also no longer permit short sales of those securities. Representatives of Goldman, Bank of America,Citigroup and Jefferies declined to comment. It’s not unusual for banks to adjust their risk controls as market conditions change. The measures may change the fortunes of retail investors lighting up Reddit message boards with their forays into day trading. Increased margin requirements could hasten the short squeezes small investors have been rushing to capitalize on. On the other hand, if hedge funds pull back on short bets due to the new restrictions, the Reddit crowd won’t have as many opportunities to chase short squeezes. Archegos Fallout Many brokerage firms have been re-examining their risk controls after some of the industry’s largest prime brokers were forced in March to liquidate the multibillion-dollar portfolio of Bill Hwang’s Archegos Capital Management at a discount, though Bank of America and Citigroup were among those that escaped the saga unscathed. The little-known family office collapsed after making a series of wrong-way bets on media and technology companies.

We have just about a minute to go to the bell. I want to bring into the stream first, David Nelson, Belpointe Wealth Management, and Sarah House. She's the Wells Fargo senior economist. But first, let's get to the markets here and see what the day's price action has in store for us. Now, the Dow is the laggard of the day. But it is up half a percent here. You can see that's good for 183 points. S&P 500 up 9/10 of a percent-- look like it's at session highs or close to it right now. And the NASDAQ, big outperform of the day, up nearly 1 and 1/2%. We'll get a check inside the NASDAQ 100 where we see the mega caps still holding onto some nice gains. Off their highs a little bit, but check out Microsoft, up 2%. Alphabet and Apple, just a little bit less than that. And what stands out is Tesla. Tesla's up 4 and 1/2%, pulling back some of those nasty losses it had in the rest of the big week. Also, look at Nvidia. That stock up 3 and 1/2% to another record high. And as we march towards that closing bell, just a quick look at the sector action for the day. We got tech and communication services, the big outperformers They are-- [BELL RINGING] [MUSIC PLAYING] SEANA SMITH: And that wraps up the trading week again. We're looking at gains across the board. Let's see where things settled if we can pull it up. The Dow closing up 180 points. The S&P also up nearly 1%. The NASDAQ was the outperformer for the entire trading day closing up 1 and 1/2%, building on the gains that we saw yesterday. We have David Nelson and Sarah House here with us to break down the action that we saw not only in the markets side, but also what we've seen through econ data. David, let me send it over to you first, because when you take a look at the market's reaction, it looks like the market was satisfied with this report even though it came in slightly weaker than what the Street was initially expecting to see. From your view, though, was it strong enough, or is it strong enough for where we should be at this point in this recovery?

2021-06-07T15:27:11.000Z,G7 finance ministers reach global minimum corporate tax dealYahoo Finance Video,"G7 finance ministers have reached a global minimum corporate tax deal. EY Global Vice Chair of Tax Kate Barton joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss. AKIKO FUJITA: For some more analysis on this, let's bring in our first guest for the hour. We've got Kate Barton, EY global vice chair of tax. Kate, it's good to talk to you today. When you think back to Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen initially sort of putting this idea on the table, she discussed this in the context of ending the race to the bottom, as she described it. If we're talking about a 15% floor here on corporate taxes, to what extent does that resolve the issue? KATE BARTON: Well, it's definitely a big step. I mean, there are a lot of countries around the world that will have to increase their tax rate if this, in fact, goes forward. The devil is going to be in the detail because do you just look at the federal tax rate, or do you look at the state or the state equivalent in countries around the world, like cantons and the like? But there are a number of countries, for example Ireland, which has got a 12 and 1/2 percent rate, which has been a longtime part of the tax policy, where they've taxed corporations at a lower rate and then have really taxed their wage-earners at a higher rate. And that's always been something that they felt like has fueled their economy. So countries have competed, really, on their headline rate. And so this will change that game. ZACK GUZMAN: I mean, when it comes to that, obviously, some countries have even used it to their advantage, as you're describing there. So how does it maybe benefit some? What are the ones that stand to benefit the most here or lose the most if this is to kind of become the way things are done? KATE BARTON: Well, this is just the start. The global minimum rate is important. But then it's all how the country, the headquarters countries taxes. And so in the US, we have worldwide taxation still. And it is important for that global minimum tax to sort of fit together, if you will, through foreign tax credits and the normal corporate rate.

2021-06-07T13:27:28.000Z,"Meme stock favorites start the week higher, GameStop earnings in focusYahoo Finance Video","Yahoo Finance's Myles Udland, Julie Hyman and Brian Sozzi break down how meme stocks are faring ahead of this week's inflation data. JULIE HYMAN: Well, as we look ahead to that inflation data, as we saw last week, markets abhor a vacuum, a news vacuum. And so one of the things that leapt into the breach were meme stocks last week and AMC in particular, as we saw that stock rise-- I think 86% was the final tally when all was said and done, even with a dip late in the week. the shares are up another 4.5% here this morning. Myles, I'm sure you were doing some deep thinking on the meme stock front over the course of the weekend and whether we would continue to see a lot of this action. I don't know that we know what exactly sparked the rally that we saw last week or the renewed interest in it, but it doesn't feel like that it's necessarily going away. MYLES UDLAND: No, I think the more that I think about it, the more that we cover these meme stocks as, really, the most interesting sub-story within the market-- because all the conversation we were just having with Brian and the direction of the economy, that's heady stuff. That is where the base of the trajectory for all of this is really formed. But the activity with meme stocks underneath the surface and the fact that it has now come up in essentially the same form a couple of times within three months-- and yet, as we discussed with Jared last week, and I'm sure we'll talk about as we get through this week, the lack of spillover between what's happened in the meme names and how sentiment within the broader market is reflected, I think, to me is the most instructive part of this story right now. I know there were a few stories out from a variety of publications over the weekend about the index industry and how some of the rally in the meme names opens that up to distortions within the construction of the index. Because obviously, if you have a market-cap-weighted index or market-cap-weighted type fund, and AMC is now double the size that it was, quadruple the size that it was, it can move that index or fund around a little bit more. Of course, if you're talking about the Russell 2000 or you're talking about even a sector-level index, its weighting is going to be still in the fractions of percentage points.

2021-06-04T20:39:15.000Z,Wall Street Versus Meme Army in AMC’s Big Share Price Divide,"(Bloomberg) -- Wall Street analysts who typically drive price action in stocks have been relegated to the role of mere extras in the market drama surrounding AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. The movie theater operator’s dizzying stock rally has created a large divide between investors and Wall Street strategists as its share soared to $47.91, more than 800% above the average forecast of analysts covering the stock tracked by Bloomberg. That gap between the two is the biggest among U.S. stocks with a market cap of $1 billion or more. The situation shows how much meme stock investors have stolen the spotlight during the pandemic and the extent of the potential losses individuals and day traders will face -- if Wall Street turns out to be right. Retail investors may eventually “become bored of the slow growth trajectory of a mature business,” Alicia Reese, an analyst who covers the stock at Wedbush Securities, said in an interview. “But the fervor is high and appears to be rising so a precipitous fall does not seem imminent.” Read more: Day Traders Bet They Can Outsmart Wall Street’s Brightest on AMC Yet small-time investors have brushed past the advice of stock pundits who have been in the investing game for decades. The two worlds collided this week as AMC sold about 20 million shares capitalizing on its unlikely rally: New York-based Mudrick Capital bought 8.5 million shares from the company, helping to drive the rally, and quickly flipped them for a profit, telling clients the stock was overvalued.Then AMC collected $587 million in an 11.55 million share sale of an at-the-market offering on Thursday. The company last said it’s asking investors for permission to sell 25 million new shares in 2022. By Friday, volatility in AMC shares had spiked to a level not seen since the previous Reddit frenzy earlier this year. The stock gained 83% for the week, marking yet another win for small-time investors. Chief Executive Officer Adam Aron played to the crowd by encouraging day traders, while taunting bears. “Watch out naysayers, $AMC is going to play on offense again. Here we come!” he said in a Twitter post on Tuesday. A day later, AMC announced that it would reward small-time investors with goodies such as special screenings and free popcorn, feeding into the meme stock frenzy. And the next day, the company warned in a regulatory filing that they could see their stakes diluted and perhaps lose everything after the new offering.

The new king of meme stocks bounced between gains and losses, closing 6.7% lower at $47.91 on Friday. It’s still up 83% on the week, adding to May’s 160% surge. It’s been quite a ride for AMC, with the stock’s surge enabling the world’s biggest movie-theater chain to sell equity and shore up its shaky balance sheet. On the brink of bankruptcy only a few months ago, the company is now the darling of retail traders, with this year’s 2,200% gain ranking as the most of any stock in the Russell 3000 Index. GameStop Corp., which started the meme-stock craze back in January, is a distant second with an advance of about 1,300%. “When does the bubble pop? I don’t know,” said Eric Handler, entertainment analyst at MKM Partners, who has a $1 target for AMC shares and sees no link between the current price and what’s actually going on at the company. “I have no idea when fundamentals will matter again.” Read more: AMC, Express Mark Golden Age for Retail-Focused Stock Sales Investors haven’t been deterred by the fact that AMC is still losing money, bleeding cash and facing a mountain of debt, as well as heavy competition.

The company collected $587 million from the sale, which came just days after it netted $230.5 million by selling equity to Mudrick Capital Management.

2021-06-07T17:40:28.000Z,A meme stock’s downward spiral: GameStop’s 14-year Fortune 500 run comes to an endFortune,"Meme stocks are making your 401(k) returns look minuscule. Since the start of 2021, the S&P 500 index has climbed 12.6%—which, if the year ended now, would be an above-average annual return. But that pales in comparison to shares of [hotlink]GameStop[/hotlink] (ticker: GME)—the alpha dog in the meme stock space—which are up a staggering 1,218% during that same span. When members of the r/WallStreetBets subreddit started buying GME and other meme stocks, including companies like BlackBerry (+109%) and AMC (+2,160%), in January, it looked like a classic pump and dump. Or a joke, in their eyes, meant to damage some hedge funds (read: Melvin Capital) while retail investors made a quick buck. For these three stocks, in particular, the dump hasn’t come. But that doesn’t rule out a pullback. Indeed, the prices of many of these meme stocks are completely out of whack with fundamentals. Just how detached are meme stocks from reality? There’s no better example than GameStop. When the 2021 edition of the Fortune 500, a ranking of the 500 largest U.S. publicly traded companies by revenue, was published last week, it did not have GameStop on it. That marked the end of GameStop’s 14-year streak on the list—including a No. 464 placement last year. Falling off the Fortune 500 list is just one of many signs that GameStop’s business model is floundering. Back in the aughts, GameStop stores in shopping malls and strip malls were packed with teenagers looking to buy and trade in games for their Xboxes and GameCubes. But in the early 2010s, that brick-and-mortar model was disrupted by the digitization of the video game industry, as more gamers began downloading new titles rather than buying physical copies. GameStop’s revenue, which peaked at $9.6 billion in 2012, had fallen to $6.5 billion by fiscal year 2020. Then the pandemic took it down another notch. During its 2021 fiscal year, which ran through Jan. 31, GameStop sales totaled $5.1 billion. Since 2012, its sales are down 47%.

Medicare-backed insurance seller Clover was among the most shorted stocks across U.S. exchanges, with Clover being the target of a report by short seller Hindenburg in February, which took a position in the company. ""The WallStreetBets forum (on Reddit) has identified (stocks with) over 30% short interests,"" said Thomas Hayes, managing member at Great Hill Capital Llc in New York. The ""meme stock"" phenomenon, which began with video game retailer GameStop Corp in January and spread to cinema operator AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc in May, has prompted the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to say it was looking into signs of market manipulation. Short interest in Clover Health is at 49.10 million shares, or 43.5% of the float, Ihor Dusaniwsky, managing director of predictive analytics at S3 said on Tuesday. Short sellers were down $465 million in mark-to-market losses on Tuesday, based on a more than 80% price gain, which raised year-to-date losses to $517 million, he said. Shorts have been building their position in Clover Health as its stock price has been rallying, Dusaniwsky said. Clover's backer, venture capitalist Chamath Palihapitiya, took the company public through a $3.7 billion reverse merger with his blank check firm in October 2020. Clover's shares were up 81.6% at $21.64 after earlier hitting a record high of $24.93. The company's options have drawn a surge of bullish action in recent days with trading volume surging to 587,000 contracts on Monday, compared with an average daily volume of under 50,000 contracts for the month of May, Trade Alert data showed.

2021-06-04T20:07:54.000Z,"Meme Stock Marauders Aside, the Average S&P 500 Bull Is Worried","(Bloomberg) -- Back in December, if you asked the typical investor what the next big move would be for the S&P 500, two-thirds would’ve said “up.” After two months of going-nowhere churn in the indexes punctuated by assorted hysterias in crypto and meme shares, barely half would say so now. For all the kookiness going on adjacent to more stolid stocks, the recent history in American risk markets is one of psychological retrenching. Institutional managers are reining in exposure. People are buying a lot more protection. Even flows to equity funds are slowing. The past week was a microcosm, with flyers like AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. and GameStop Corp. reprising the crowd-sourced moonshots that first launched in January, while the rest of the market sat still despite a host of catalysts ranging from President Joe Biden’s new tax pitch to weaker-than-expected data on the labor market. If anything, the gravity-defying rally in meme stocks is arousing angst for anyone who pays attention to business fundamentals. With equities hovering near the highest price-earnings ratios since the dot-com era, the market reflects what Chris Senyek calls a “perfection scenario,” where the economic outlook continues to improve, while inflation stays tame. That may limit future returns, he said. “Perfection is extremely difficult to attain,” Senyek, chief investment strategist at Wolfe Research, wrote in a note to clients earlier in the week. “We do believe that the next 10% move in U.S. equity markets is down, not up.” And there’s no shortage of threats on the horizon. President Biden has proposed raising corporate taxes to fund his infrastructure bill, while the Federal Reserve is expected to consider rolling back part of its monetary stimulus later this year. Not to mention the pressure on profit margins that American businesses face from surging prices on everything from lumber to oil and computer chips. In fact, either inflation or higher interest rates are cited as the biggest risk to equities in the latest survey that Evercore ISI conducted with investors and corporate clients. In the poll, released Friday, the proportion of respondents seeing the next 10% move in the stock market as being up has fallen to 51% from 66% in December.

2021-06-04T20:03:54.000Z,It’s ‘too soon’ to declare peak EPS: Investment strategist,"Investors should be wary of predicting a decline in earnings, BMO Capital Markets Chief Investment Strategist Brian Belski said this week, even as some analysts worry that the market's rebound could be showing signs of wear. Despite high earnings per share (EPS) growth throughout 2021, Belski does not believe the data supports a dropoff or turning point in the near future, he told Yahoo Finance Live in an interview on Wednesday. First, Belski says, analysts have been too pessimistic with earnings projections. “The secular trend of analysts really being too negative on earnings [is] really setting [them] up to under promise and over deliver,” Belski said. Additionally, the reopening of the economy may give rise to further difficulties in predicting peak earnings. “The economy is just now opening up. And we think that numbers, when you add all that up, could be too low,” he said. “So this whole notion of really satisfying yourself with looking at consensus numbers may be a little too early.” Q1 earnings in 2021 far exceeded expectations, justifying optimistic economic outlooks. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) was trading less than 1% off its all-time highs at the end of May. Still, Belski says, “it's way too soon to say that earnings have peaked and that the markets are changing.” Recent market frenzies driven by retail investors have also been causes for concern with regard to market stability. But the meteoric rise of AMC (AMC) and other meme stocks will have little effect on market fundamentals, Belski says. ”Just like bitcoin (BTC-USD) or just like Tesla (TSLA), I think they're more sideshows, quite frankly,” Belski said. “I think, too, once and if and when we start getting back to work, we'll stop hearing about this stuff in the meme stocks … in terms of its importance with respect to fundamentals, it's zero.” “This is going to be a fundamental-driven market,” Belski said. “And I think that's very positive.”          ",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/its-too-soon-to-declare-peak-eps-investment-strategist-200354546.html

2021-06-04T19:19:28.000Z,"Disney+ app downloads jump as 'Cruella,' 'A Quiet Place II' mark movie comeback","The ""stay-at-home"" effect that kept movie goers glued to their television sets during the COVID-19 crisis has yet to abate, new data suggests, even as theaters throw open their doors ahead of the summer blockbuster season. Underscoring the continued popularity of streaming platforms, ""Cruella"" delivered a download bump for Disney+ (DIS) as the live-action, summer tentpole simultaneously battled ""A Quiet Place II"" at the box office last weekend.   According to exclusive data from mobile analytics platform App Annie, Disney+ app downloads jumped 58% day-over-day as the movie, starring Emma Stone, debuted on May 28.  The surge helped the service reach #4 among entertainment apps and #22 overall by U.S. iPhone downloads, up from its #7 and #54 spots, respectively, compared to the day prior. The film, which was available on Disney+ for a $30 rental fee, had a spotty theatrical opening. It garnered just $21.3 million over Memorial Day weekend before settling at $26.5 million after the holiday.  Yet despite its lackluster performance, 'Cruella' was still the second best-performing movie at the box office over the long weekend — but it significantly trailed behind its biggest competitor, 'A Quiet Place II.' The John Krasinski-directed horror sequel earned a whopping $57 million, shattering expectations and reviving optimism among experts and analysts that movies are making a comeback.  On Thursday, Benchmark raised its box office estimates, which gave IMAX (IMAX) shares a fleeting boost.  Analyst Michael Hickey, who raised his price target on IMAX to $25 a share, said in a note, “We have again raised our second quarter fiscal 2021 IMAX box office estimates, as the box office continues its resounding bounce back as consumers flock to theaters in post-pandemic pent-up demand.” Separately, HBO Max (T) also saw strong download momentum following its hotly anticipated ""Friends"" reunion.

2021-06-07T18:52:00.000Z,Bitcoin's slump opens the door to a tax loophole every investor needs to knowMoneyWise,"A months-long bull run has finally driven crypto prices over a cliff. Bitcoin, Ethereum and Dogecoin prices are on their way back up after all three cryptocurrencies saw their values plummet in May, but investors will be waiting some time before they recover the $590 billion in value the global crypto market shed between May 12 and May 17. If you’re a crypto investor down in the dumps, there’s a strategy you can use that might take some of the sting out of your recent losses. It’s called a “wash sale,” and it could help mitigate your losses by creating some pretty tasty tax savings — it could even be a reason to increase your stake in crypto now that prices are down. Cryptocurrencies aren’t regulated as securities. In fact, the IRS actually taxes them as property. That means the rules that apply to typical stocks don’t apply to crypto, and the rules around ""wash sales"" don’t apply. A wash sale takes place when you sell your stocks for a loss and then, within 30 days, you acquire more of the same securities, either through an outright purchase, a taxable trade or an option to buy. If you scoop up more of the same stocks in that 30-day period, the IRS will prohibit you from using the losses incurred on the sale to reduce the capital gains taxes generated by your more successful investments. But with crypto, there’s a lot more fun to be had. Your losses can be used to draw down — or completely wipe out — your capital gains taxes. You can also buy more of the same crypto asset and try to capitalize on a swift rebound without having to wait 30 days, which, in crypto time, is forever. Let’s say your Bitcoin investment lost you $50,000 a few weeks back, but the gains from your stocks and mutual funds this year earn you $50,000. Your Bitcoin losses would offset the taxes you would otherwise have to pay on your capital gains. If you’re going to try and use the wash sale rules to your advantage, just make sure you’re not repurchasing too soon after making the sale. The IRS can still prevent you from claiming the tax credit if they think the sale lacks legitimacy. And don’t plan on trying this with Coinbase shares. They play by the same rules as every other stock.              ",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bitcoins-slump-opens-door-tax-185200333.html
2021-06-08T11:59:05.000Z,Bitcoin falls to three-week low as IRS seeks approval for reporting rulesReuters,"LONDON (Reuters) - Bitcoin fell to a three-week low on Tuesday amid signs of institutional investor caution, while the head of the U.S. Internal Revenue Service called for lawmakers to provide authority for tighter reporting rules on crypto transfers. IRS chief Charles Rettig said on Tuesday that Congress needs to provide clear statutory authority for the tax agency to collect information on cryptocurrency transfers valued at over $10,000 that largely go unreported. Rettig said before the Senate Finance Committee that cryptocurrency market capitalization is over $2 trillion, with more than 8,600 exchanges worldwide. ""By design, most crypto virtual currencies are designed to stay off the radar screen, so we will be challenged right now."" Earlier a spokesperson for British fund manager Ruffer Investment Management confirmed that it exited its bitcoin bet in April with a $1.1 billion profit amid worries over risk after quick gains in the cryptocurrency's price. Ruffer made its bitcoin bet in November, in what was then one of the largest signals of rising institutional interest in the digital currency. By mid-December it was worth around 550 million pounds ($745 million). ""Long term, we remain interested in digital assets and the role they can play in real wealth preservation,"" the spokesperson said. ""In the short term, following the sharp increase in the bitcoin price, we felt bitcoin was exhibiting more risk."" Ruffer's bitcoin profit was first reported by The Sunday Times. Meanwhile, MicroStrategy Inc, a major bitcoin corporate backer, has increased the size of a junk-bond sale to help buy more bitcoin, now targeting $500 million, Bloomberg News reported on Tuesday. Bitcoin was last trading at $32,055.20, down 4.5% on the day. It bottomed at $31,025, the lowest price since a shakeout on May 19 dropped it to near $30,000 for the first time since January. The cryptocurrency has slumped by half since hitting a record of almost $65,000 in April.

2021-06-04T18:29:51.000Z,Meme Stock Rally Puts Spotlight on Russell 2000 Index Reshuffle,"(Bloomberg) -- A busy week for trading desks won’t end with the closing bell, at least for investors tracking FTSE Russell indexes. The index provider is set to announce preliminary changes after the close, and the Russell 2000 will take center stage with tweaks to the gauge of small-cap companies that over the past year have become not so small. That’s because of the surge in meme stocks like AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. and GameStop Corp. The average stock in the 2,000-member index, at $1.7 billion in market value, has grown about 50% since the last reshuffle a year ago. AMC, now the index’s heaviest-weighted member, has a market value that’s more than four times that of Silicon Laboratories Inc., the gauge’s largest member at last year’s reshuffle. The movie-theater chain has contributed the most to the Russell 2000’s rally this year after surging 2,300%, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Changes in sector weighting is another development to watch. Energy, which makes up less than 4% of the Russell 2000 Index, have more than doubled in value over the past year. Strategists at Jefferies expect the reshuffle to at least partly reflect that. Today’s announcement due after the bell won’t be final, as the index provider will make tweaks to the list of additions and deletions during the next week. The changes will take effect after the market close on June 25. Russell U.S. Index membership eligibility for the 2021 reconstitution is determined from published information and market capitalizations at market close of May 7, according to the index provider. At that point, AMC was worth $4.3 billion, well below Friday’s $26 billion level. FTSE Russell’s global stock indexes are used as benchmarks for about $16 trillion in assets, the company said in a statement during last year’s reconstitution. More than $9 trillion in investments track Russell indexes in the U.S., which include the Russell 1000 and Russell 2000.

Currently, Summit’s lead product candidate, ridinilazole, is engaged in two pivotal global Phase 3 trials, Ri-CoDIFy 1 & 2, each enrolling approximately 680 patients vs. the standard of care (vancomycin) for the treatment and reduction of recurrence of C. difficile infections, in addition to an adolescent trial, Ri-CoDIFy 3. Commercialization of ridinilazole for the treatment and the reduction of recurrence of CDI is subject to regulatory approvals.

2021-06-04T17:28:45.000Z,This meme stock exploded 62% in one day and this Wall Street analyst has had enough,"Hat tip to you, Bank of America analyst Curtis Nagle for adhering to some very basic principles of investing, which still matter even though meme stock traders couldn't care less about valuation methodologies, free cash flow outlooks or margin structures.  After seeing Bed Bath & Beyond (BBY) shares explode 62% on June 2, Nagle said in a research note on Friday that it's time for him step back from the volatile stock.  ""This [move in the stock] comes in the context of no significant updates from Bed Bath & Beyond or any other material news. Bed Bath & Beyond did release a press release on 6/2/21 regarding the launch of three new private label brands but this was already expected by investors and is not material, in our view. Instead we believe that the rapid appreciation in Bed Bath & Beyond's shares is being driven by another surge in interest and trading led by retail investors,"" Nagle said. ""This follows a very large but short-term move in late January of this year. We also note that Bed Bath & Beyond's share price increase corresponds to big moves over the past week with ""meme stocks"" such as GameStop, AMC and BlackBerry. As a result, we move to No Rating as we believe shares of Bed Bath & Beyond are no longer trading on fundamentals. Investors should no longer rely upon our previous investment opinion or price objective.""  Nagle isn't the first sell-side analyst this year to remove a rating or price target — or just outright drop coverage — of a company swept up into meme stock mania. Even still, as this former analyst could attest these are drastic actions that are far from the norm among the analyst community on Wall Street. It's a group that prides itself on making great calls after conducting granular research and maintaining good relationships with executive teams.   But the surprise maneuvers do underscore how impossible it is for an analyst to properly cover a company — which includes talking with management, modeling out future earnings and communicating those things to clients —amid an environment fast-filling up with a new generation of retail traders. In this topsy turvy backdrop, a veteran analyst could go from being a hero one day to being out of a job tomorrow simply because a CEO like Adam Aron of AMC conducts an interview with a YouTube influencer.

2021-06-04T16:40:19.000Z,"Wall Street Bets: Meme Stocks AMC, BB Take Investors on Roller Coaster Ride","Investors have gone along for the ride, vowing to hold on until they put the final nail in the coffin of short-sellers. Despite the volatility, shares of AMC Entertainment, in particular, have already almost doubled in price this week despite Thursday’s decline of close to 20%. AMC appears to be the tide lifting the meme-stock boat as other names including MicroVision, BlackBerry, Bed Bath & Beyond, Koss Corp and GameStop have either flipped green or are off their lows of the day. Wall Street analysts are doing the best they can keeping up with the WallStreetBets movement, which has seen individual investors gain influence in the stock market rally. Most recently, Wedbush Securities has shown its true colors, which apparently is a gray area. After shares of AMC touched on USD 60 this week, the firm lifted its price target on the stock by USD 1 to USD 7.50. At the same time, however, Wedbush analyst Alicia Reese also suggested a “justified price target” would be “as high as USD 10,” saying in a report, “AMC has made the best of its current ‘Meme Stock’ status by selling shares at a premium, and has raised significant capital doing so.” Another meme stock that is getting a lot of attention lately is BlackBerry. In the month of June so far, BlackBerry, the company behind the physical mobile keyboard that is making a comeback, is up nearly 30% to USD 15. The stock is coming off its strongest trading day ever based on trading volume after 528 million shares changed hands on Thursday, as per FactSet data cited by Barron’s, compared to today’s 104 million in volume as of midday today. For context, BlackBerry’s trading volume has only surpassed the 200 million threshold on eight separate occasions since the stock started trading. BlackBerry is trading below its highs of the year, since soaring to nearly USD 29 in January 2021, its highest level in a decade. After seeing what they could do to GameStop and AMC, the WallStreetBets crowd is reaching for the stars with BlackBerry, with visions of the company becoming the next Apple dancing in their heads.

2021-06-07T19:37:29.000Z,Meme Stock Bulls Take Back Control as Hedge Fund Battle RagesFX Empire,"After a wave of selling heading into the weekend, retail investors have wrestled back control of their favorite shorted stocks, including AMC Entertainment and GameStop. The stocks are off their highs of the day, and retail investors are convinced that something shady is going on. Short sellers are swinging back after losing USD 2.2 billion from AMC’s rally last week. There are theories of traders pulling out all the stops — including the illegal practice of naked shorting, which is currently trending on Twitter. Shares of AMC have galloped 16% today but still failed to cross the psychologically important USD 60 level, where the movie chain stock closed above on June 2 for the first time. While AMC might be off its peak, investors don’t have much to clamor about considering that the stock has skyrocketed more than 467% since early May. Fellow WallStreetBets stock GameStop is tacking on close to 11% in today’s session. The stock has gained more than 1,400% year-to-date for a market cap of USD 19.4 billion. GameStop investors have proven to be a loyal bunch as it hasn’t always been easy to hold. But those who have stuck around continue to be rewarded with more potential runway for gains. Ihor Dusaniwsky, managing director of predictive analytics at S3 Partners, revealed in a tweet that GMC and AMC each have a short squeeze risk score attached of 10 out of a possible 10. Meanwhile, the WallStreetBets crowd has taken over Twitter, with #nakedshorting trending on the social media site. To be clear, unlike regular shorting, which is legal, naked selling is not legal. It has to do with selling shares that have not been issued yet. Nonetheless, it still happens in the market. Naked shorting is how 140% of GameStop’s float can have short interest, as pointed out by Charles Payne on Fox Business. Christian, Smith & Jewell Law Firm Attorney Wes Christian said he blames the prime brokers that are custodying the assets as well as market makers for this behavior.

That’s well below its daily average trading volume of 14.4 million shares. BlackBerry (NYSE:BB) stock is getting it the worst today with one of Reddit’s favorites falling over 5% as of this writing. That comes alongside heavy trading of the shares with some 104 million having changed hands. That’s more than the daily average trading volume of 28.6 million shares for the stock. While the meme stock rally might not continue, that doesn’t mean there aren’t other short squeeze targets to consider.

2021-06-07T17:40:28.000Z,A meme stock’s downward spiral: GameStop’s 14-year Fortune 500 run comes to an endFortune,"Meme stocks are making your 401(k) returns look minuscule. Since the start of 2021, the S&P 500 index has climbed 12.6%—which, if the year ended now, would be an above-average annual return. But that pales in comparison to shares of [hotlink]GameStop[/hotlink] (ticker: GME)—the alpha dog in the meme stock space—which are up a staggering 1,218% during that same span. When members of the r/WallStreetBets subreddit started buying GME and other meme stocks, including companies like BlackBerry (+109%) and AMC (+2,160%), in January, it looked like a classic pump and dump. Or a joke, in their eyes, meant to damage some hedge funds (read: Melvin Capital) while retail investors made a quick buck. For these three stocks, in particular, the dump hasn’t come. But that doesn’t rule out a pullback. Indeed, the prices of many of these meme stocks are completely out of whack with fundamentals. Just how detached are meme stocks from reality? There’s no better example than GameStop. When the 2021 edition of the Fortune 500, a ranking of the 500 largest U.S. publicly traded companies by revenue, was published last week, it did not have GameStop on it. That marked the end of GameStop’s 14-year streak on the list—including a No. 464 placement last year. Falling off the Fortune 500 list is just one of many signs that GameStop’s business model is floundering. Back in the aughts, GameStop stores in shopping malls and strip malls were packed with teenagers looking to buy and trade in games for their Xboxes and GameCubes. But in the early 2010s, that brick-and-mortar model was disrupted by the digitization of the video game industry, as more gamers began downloading new titles rather than buying physical copies. GameStop’s revenue, which peaked at $9.6 billion in 2012, had fallen to $6.5 billion by fiscal year 2020. Then the pandemic took it down another notch. During its 2021 fiscal year, which ran through Jan. 31, GameStop sales totaled $5.1 billion. Since 2012, its sales are down 47%.

2021-06-08T15:59:58.000Z,Wendy's just became the first fast-food meme stock — but there is a catchYahoo Finance,"Beloved burger and Frosty chain Wendy's (WEN) has won the honor of being the first fast-food stock to get roped into the red-hot meme stock trade. Shares of Wendy's spiked 16% in early afternoon trading on Tuesday after a favorable mention by traders on Reddit. The Wendy's ticker page was the second most trafficked on the Yahoo Finance platform, behind other meme crowd favorite Clover Health (whose stock popped 55% out of nowhere). Wendy's stock outperformed the slight decline in meme stock darling AMC Entertainment and a 6% rise in the OG of meme trading, GameStop (which reports earnings on Wednesday).  ""We’re aware of the unusual trading activity this morning and we’re closely monitoring,"" a Wendy's spokesperson told Yahoo Finance.  There are at least two striking things with the out of left field move in Wendy's shares Tuesday.  First, only 4.64% of the company's outstanding shares are sold short, according to Yahoo Finance Plus data. That runs counter to the high short position stocks that have characterized this year's meme stock trade. In other words, Wall Street is in no way betting against the future of Wendy's, dissimilar to GameStop and AMC.  And that brings us to the second point. The reason why Wall Street doesn't hate Wendy's is that unlike other meme stocks, Wendy's is a fundamentally sound business that is growing.  Wendy's U.S. same-store sales in the first quarter surged 13.5%, powered by diners heading back out after getting their COVID-19 vaccine and trying the chain's new breakfast menu. Digital ordering and a push into more premium chicken sandwiches also lit a fire under first quarter sales. Wendy's same-store sales internationally rose 7.9%. The Dave Thomas creation almost beat out McDonald's U.S.'s 13.6% same-store sales increase in the quarter, the latter of which could be seen as a letdown considering it launched three new chicken sandwiches. Same-store sales for Burger King in the U.S. rose 6.6% in the quarter.

2021-06-07T07:04:09.000Z,"AMC, GameStop, Blackberry Poised For A Quiet StartInvesting.com","By Dhirendra Tripathi Investing.com — Meme stocks such as AMC (NYSE:AMC), GameStop (NYSE:GME) and BlackBerry (NYSE:BB) were all up 2%-2.5% in Monday’s premarket, pointing to a relatively subdued start to the week for investors accustomed to double digit gains. In the case of AMC, the hottest of them for now, traders may be trying to gauge where the company is headed. After raising $1.24 billion in equity in three installments in less than a month, each at a different price, it filed a preliminary proxy on Thursday seeking permission to sell 25 million more shares in 2022. It has been a roller-coaster for AMC traders who saw their stock double in just one session on Wednesday to hit a high of $83.63, only to fall in double digits on announcement of a new equity raise. The shares closed at $66.80 Friday. The pandemic has caused AMC's long-term debt levels to soar to $5.4 billion as of the first three months of this year from less than $2 billion in 2016. And it’s still losing money, with analysts expecting another $100 million to go over the next 12 months.

2021-06-07T18:17:49.000Z,Reddit’s WallStreetBets has a new favorite stockFortune,"GameStop and AMC are trading at levels no one could have imagined a year ago. Now, Reddit’s r/WallStreetBets community is looking for the next company whose stock is set to explode—and seems to have settled on Blackberry. The company behind the once iconic line of pagers and smartphones has seen its shares increase 137% year to date. That’s nothing compared to the 1,472% increase in GameStop and the 2,705% bump for AMC, but it’s the biggest surge the company has seen in two years. And, judging by chatter on r/WallStreetBets, interest is growing. A look at the subreddit Monday finds seven of the top 20 posts are dedicated solely to Blackberry. (Four others are focused on praising Clover Health Investments.) The stock is currently trading in the $15-$16 range, but the most enthusiastic investors are hoping to see it hit $50. “Don’t stop, BBelieving!!” encouraged user TehlorO. Meanwhile, user Substantial_Diver_34 showed a screenshot of what he says is his portfolio that is 100% committed to Blackberry, with over 6,400 shares. It was, at the time of the shot, down $14,000. The post is entitled “What have I done?” Other users gave nothing but encouragement. “I'll tell you what you've done: You've guaranteed your place amongst the millionares,” wrote kingandr3, while Firesice offered “You put in a winning bid...just needs a little time.” WSB bulls say Blackberry has grown from being a phone company to a cybersecurity firm that has deals with [hotlink]Amazon[/hotlink] and others and could be well positioned to take a position in the electric vehicle marketspace. Analysts aren’t as sure. Four firms currently have “Sell” ratings on the company, with only one suggesting investors buy. Of course, the r/WallStreetBets effect often defies the logic of analysts. AMC and [hotlink]GameStop[/hotlink] were floundering a year ago. Now, their stock prices and market caps have increased so much in recent months that they could join the Russell 1000 by the end of the month.

2021-06-07T19:37:29.000Z,Meme Stock Bulls Take Back Control as Hedge Fund Battle RagesFX Empire,"After a wave of selling heading into the weekend, retail investors have wrestled back control of their favorite shorted stocks, including AMC Entertainment and GameStop. The stocks are off their highs of the day, and retail investors are convinced that something shady is going on. Short sellers are swinging back after losing USD 2.2 billion from AMC’s rally last week. There are theories of traders pulling out all the stops — including the illegal practice of naked shorting, which is currently trending on Twitter. Shares of AMC have galloped 16% today but still failed to cross the psychologically important USD 60 level, where the movie chain stock closed above on June 2 for the first time. While AMC might be off its peak, investors don’t have much to clamor about considering that the stock has skyrocketed more than 467% since early May. Fellow WallStreetBets stock GameStop is tacking on close to 11% in today’s session. The stock has gained more than 1,400% year-to-date for a market cap of USD 19.4 billion. GameStop investors have proven to be a loyal bunch as it hasn’t always been easy to hold. But those who have stuck around continue to be rewarded with more potential runway for gains. Ihor Dusaniwsky, managing director of predictive analytics at S3 Partners, revealed in a tweet that GMC and AMC each have a short squeeze risk score attached of 10 out of a possible 10. Meanwhile, the WallStreetBets crowd has taken over Twitter, with #nakedshorting trending on the social media site. To be clear, unlike regular shorting, which is legal, naked selling is not legal. It has to do with selling shares that have not been issued yet. Nonetheless, it still happens in the market. Naked shorting is how 140% of GameStop’s float can have short interest, as pointed out by Charles Payne on Fox Business. Christian, Smith & Jewell Law Firm Attorney Wes Christian said he blames the prime brokers that are custodying the assets as well as market makers for this behavior.

The electric delivery vehicle maker rose 57% this week, prompting Cowen to drop the stock to market perform from outperform with little near-term upside ahead, CNBC reported. “We view shares as fairly valued following the recent rally which we view as not supported by fundamentals or company specific catalysts,” the firm said. It's been a wild week for meme stocks like GameStop (NYSE:GME) and AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC), which has twice sold shares this week generating about $800 million in cash, tapping into the thirst of retail investors. Those traders have been targeting institutional investors who have shorted companies anticipating the stocks will drop.

CNBC said Workhorse has 41% of its float sold short, compared to 21% for AMC Entertainment. Cowen said the company has up to a year before the competition heats up, with Ford and GM on its heels. Earlier this year, Workhorse lost out on a major contract with the U.S. Postal Service. Last year, short-seller Hindenburg Research called out the company's “astronomical valuation” of about $1.5 billion. It's currently got a market capitalization of $1.6 billion.

Stocks recently featured in the blog include: AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. AMC, Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. BBBY, GameStop Corp. GME, GrowGeneration Corp. GRWG and Micron Technology, Inc. MU. AMC Entertainment shares soared nearly 100% Wednesday, while fellow so-called meme stocks Bed Bath & Beyond and GameStop jumped 60% and 13%, respectively. Despite these huge gains the broader market was far more subdued with all three major U.S. indexes up marginally on the day. The big meme moves occurred on another low volume day following the long Memorial Day weekend. The trading volume will likely remain far below average as summer begins and people start vacationing again. More cities around the U.S. are starting to reopen nearly completely amid the successful coronavirus vaccine push. The economic boom, coupled with the Fed's easy money policies, supply chain setbacks, government checks, and other factors have all contributed to rising prices that brought out inflation fears after April's 4.2% CPI figure was released. Clearly, rising prices must be monitored and Wall Street will be watching the Fed closely. But the central bank has continued to remain firm that inflation will be ""transitory."" Investors should also know that even if the Fed is forced to raise rates, yields will likely remain historically low, extending there is no alternative investing. For example, the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield has moved slightly above 3% only a few times in the last decade, after remaining well above the threshold in the pre-financial crisis world—it has hovered around 1.6% for much of the past three months.

2021-06-07T19:37:29.000Z,Meme Stock Bulls Take Back Control as Hedge Fund Battle RagesFX Empire,"After a wave of selling heading into the weekend, retail investors have wrestled back control of their favorite shorted stocks, including AMC Entertainment and GameStop. The stocks are off their highs of the day, and retail investors are convinced that something shady is going on. Short sellers are swinging back after losing USD 2.2 billion from AMC’s rally last week. There are theories of traders pulling out all the stops — including the illegal practice of naked shorting, which is currently trending on Twitter. Shares of AMC have galloped 16% today but still failed to cross the psychologically important USD 60 level, where the movie chain stock closed above on June 2 for the first time. While AMC might be off its peak, investors don’t have much to clamor about considering that the stock has skyrocketed more than 467% since early May. Fellow WallStreetBets stock GameStop is tacking on close to 11% in today’s session. The stock has gained more than 1,400% year-to-date for a market cap of USD 19.4 billion. GameStop investors have proven to be a loyal bunch as it hasn’t always been easy to hold. But those who have stuck around continue to be rewarded with more potential runway for gains. Ihor Dusaniwsky, managing director of predictive analytics at S3 Partners, revealed in a tweet that GMC and AMC each have a short squeeze risk score attached of 10 out of a possible 10. Meanwhile, the WallStreetBets crowd has taken over Twitter, with #nakedshorting trending on the social media site. To be clear, unlike regular shorting, which is legal, naked selling is not legal. It has to do with selling shares that have not been issued yet. Nonetheless, it still happens in the market. Naked shorting is how 140% of GameStop’s float can have short interest, as pointed out by Charles Payne on Fox Business. Christian, Smith & Jewell Law Firm Attorney Wes Christian said he blames the prime brokers that are custodying the assets as well as market makers for this behavior.

He is CEO and CIO of Tuttle Capital Management. Thanks so much for joining me today, Matthew. MATTHEW TUTTLE: Thank you for having me. ALISSA CORAM: So first of all, FOMO is definitely a catchy phrase out there right now, the fear of missing out. And I think many investors experience that. Sound investing is based on rules. But emotion is also a very big part of investing. So give us your take on how investors can actually use this FOMO to their advantage. MATTHEW TUTTLE: Yeah, so there's so much going on right now in markets, more than we've ever seen. So you've got the meme stocks. You've got the crypto. You've got the value stocks. So what FOMO is designed to do is allow investors to get access to all of those areas. And then going forward, whatever it happens to be the hot area, because it's going to change over time, but to do it in a smarter way. So we're going to have the GameStops. We're going to have the AMCs. We're going to have some of the Bitcoin things and the blockchain things. But we're going got weight those according to downside volatility so we're never going to have a situation where we're in a whole bunch of stuff in large amounts that gets you crushed.

""They're trying to hold strong, and they believe they're going to drive this to the moon."" The movie theater chain’s shares ended the day down 6.7% to $47.91 after trading in both positive and negative territory during the session. AMC has been at the center of a fresh wave of buying by retail investors who hyped the stock in forums such as Reddit’s WallStreetBets, breathing new life into a phenomenon that began with January’s more than 1,600% gain in GameStop. Meme stocks got the name because their explosion in trading volume stems from interest and promotion on social media. The past week’s blistering rally saw the market capitalization of AMC, which was at the brink of bankruptcy not long ago, swell to nearly $24 billion and put its year-to-date gain at 2,160%. The rise in part reflects optimism about the re-opening of public venues like cinemas after pandemic shutdowns, but most analysts say that the scale of the rally is out of line with AMC's fundamentals. Despite the big gains, short interest in AMC held relatively steady during the week, with 88.20 million shares shorted by the end of Thursday's session equating to 17.65% of AMC's float, according to the latest available data from S3 Partners. ""We have seen AMC short-covering this week, but by no means are we seeing a wholesale short squeeze in this stock at the moment,"" said Ihor Dusaniwsky, managing director of predictive analytics at S3.

2021-06-04T05:35:12.000Z,AMC Weaker Premarket After Raising More Funds,"By Dhirendra Tripathi  Investing – AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) stock looks set to weaken for the second consecutive day, trading 5% lower premarket after a near 18% fall Thursday. The stock's recent violent rally was abruptly cut short Thursday by the company’s announcement of a fresh issue of shares, of up to 11.55 million. The movie theatre chain managed to complete the stock sale the same day, raising $587.4 million in the process with issue of maximum number of shares it intended to sell. The exercise brings the total funds raised through equity issues to $1.24 billion. It did so in three instalments, each at a different price, in less than a month. Additionally, it filed a preliminary proxy on Thursday seeking permission to sell 25 million more shares in 2022. AMC shares had more than doubled in Wednesday's session a day after it issued 8.5 million shares to Mudrick Capital, which the hedge fund sold at a profit within a day of investing the money. Its stock were at one point more than 3700% higher from their 52-week low, but this hasn’t changed the economic reality surrounding the company. The pandemic has caused its long-term debt levels to soar to $5.4 billion as of the first three months of this year from less than $2 billion in 2016. And it’s still losing money, with analysts expecting another $100 million to go over the next 12 months.

2021-06-07T19:37:29.000Z,Meme Stock Bulls Take Back Control as Hedge Fund Battle RagesFX Empire,"After a wave of selling heading into the weekend, retail investors have wrestled back control of their favorite shorted stocks, including AMC Entertainment and GameStop. The stocks are off their highs of the day, and retail investors are convinced that something shady is going on. Short sellers are swinging back after losing USD 2.2 billion from AMC’s rally last week. There are theories of traders pulling out all the stops — including the illegal practice of naked shorting, which is currently trending on Twitter. Shares of AMC have galloped 16% today but still failed to cross the psychologically important USD 60 level, where the movie chain stock closed above on June 2 for the first time. While AMC might be off its peak, investors don’t have much to clamor about considering that the stock has skyrocketed more than 467% since early May. Fellow WallStreetBets stock GameStop is tacking on close to 11% in today’s session. The stock has gained more than 1,400% year-to-date for a market cap of USD 19.4 billion. GameStop investors have proven to be a loyal bunch as it hasn’t always been easy to hold. But those who have stuck around continue to be rewarded with more potential runway for gains. Ihor Dusaniwsky, managing director of predictive analytics at S3 Partners, revealed in a tweet that GMC and AMC each have a short squeeze risk score attached of 10 out of a possible 10. Meanwhile, the WallStreetBets crowd has taken over Twitter, with #nakedshorting trending on the social media site. To be clear, unlike regular shorting, which is legal, naked selling is not legal. It has to do with selling shares that have not been issued yet. Nonetheless, it still happens in the market. Naked shorting is how 140% of GameStop’s float can have short interest, as pointed out by Charles Payne on Fox Business. Christian, Smith & Jewell Law Firm Attorney Wes Christian said he blames the prime brokers that are custodying the assets as well as market makers for this behavior.

2021-06-04T05:23:12.000Z,"Payrolls, AMC Volatility, Crude and M&A Activity - What's Moving Markets","By Peter Nurse Investing.com -- Nonfarm payrolls are the highlight of the day, if not the month, while AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) is expected to remain volatile and crude oil also pushes higher. Wall Street is seen starting lower, despite the recent surge of M&A activity. Here's what's moving markets on Friday, June 4th. 1. It’s payrolls day The U.S. labor market appears to be picking up steam with Thursday’s jobless claims and private job gains data coming in ahead of expectations, but now the attention turns to May’s nonfarm payrolls report for confirmation. Expectations at the start of the week were for 650,000 jobs to have been added last month, but after Thursday’s strong numbers these have started to climb. That said, after last month's massive miss, who knows what the number will be! Still, the conditions are conducive for a strong number. The success of the country’s vaccination program has resulted in millions of fully-vaccinated adults eager to resume their lives, fewer pandemic restrictions, reopened schools and offices equipped to welcome back workers. Private payrolls increased by 978,000 jobs last month, the ADP National Employment Report showed on Thursday, the biggest increase since June last year, while weekly applications for U.S. state unemployment insurance dipped below 400,000 for the first time during the pandemic. The only thing stopping economists going full bore bullish is caution after last month’s major surprise. In April, payrolls rose 266,000, though economists had expected 1 million. That marked the biggest downside miss on records dating back to 1996. “The primary interpretation of this underwhelming report was that labor shortages and supply chain issues were holding back the numbers rather than a lack of economic momentum,” said analysts at investment management firm Brooks Macdonald, in a note. “Pleasingly, since the report, weekly unemployment claims figures have beaten expectations with the result that economists expect last month to be a blip rather than anything else.”                                     ",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/payrolls-amc-volatility-crude-m-052312527.html

The money-losing movie-theater chain is among the five most-traded U.S. stocks over the past week on both Vested Finance and Stockal, two India-focused platforms for retail investors to buy U.S. equities. AMC Entertainment has accounted for 14% of trades on Vested this week, a greater proportion than Tesla Inc., Shopify Inc. and Facebook Inc. AMC Entertainment closed 18% lower on Thursday after soaring 95% on Wednesday. Its dizzying surge in the past few weeks has pushed its market capitalization briefly above $33 billion. The craze for so-called meme shares such as AMC and GameStop Corp. is being fueled by pandemic-led lockdowns and low-fee trading plans that have encouraged new investors into global share markets. “Due to social media platforms like Reddit, information today travels quickly across borders and an Indian investor is as plugged into the U.S. markets as their counterparts in the U.S.,” said Viram Shah, chief executive officer at Vested in Mumbai. “Some retail Indian investors are driven by news and want to be part of any global trends or movements.” Sitashwa Srivastava, co-founder and co-chief executive officer of Stockal, said that in the last three to five months, “people have been chasing high volatility stocks a lot more. GameStop happened, and now, AMC is of great interest.” Korean Favorite Korean investors snapped up $225 million of AMC shares from Monday through Thursday, according to Korea Securities Depository data. That total is getting close to three times the amount spent on the second-most-purchased counter, Tesla, at $82 million. A popular online forum among Korean retail investors contained dozens of posts from traders known locally as “ants,” discussing the prospects for AMC stock prices, and whether Blackberry Ltd. might replace AMC as the next meme target.

2021-06-08T10:36:25.000Z,Clover Health soars as 'meme stock' rally expandsReuters,"(Reuters) -Shares of Clover Health Investments Corp surged as much as 109% on Tuesday as it became a new focus for small individual traders on social media platforms who have prompted rallies in heavily shorted U.S. stocks this year. Medicare-backed insurance seller Clover was among the most shorted stocks across U.S. exchanges, with Clover being the target of a report by short seller Hindenburg in February, which took a position in the company. ""The WallStreetBets forum (on Reddit) has identified (stocks with) over 30% short interests,"" said Thomas Hayes, managing member at Great Hill Capital Llc in New York. The ""meme stock"" phenomenon, which began with video game retailer GameStop Corp in January and spread to cinema operator AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc in May, has prompted the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to say it was looking into signs of market manipulation. Short interest in Clover Health is at 49.10 million shares, or 43.5% of the float, Ihor Dusaniwsky, managing director of predictive analytics at S3 said on Tuesday. Short sellers were down $465 million in mark-to-market losses on Tuesday, based on a more than 80% price gain, which raised year-to-date losses to $517 million, he said. Shorts have been building their position in Clover Health as its stock price has been rallying, Dusaniwsky said. Clover's backer, venture capitalist Chamath Palihapitiya, took the company public through a $3.7 billion reverse merger with his blank check firm in October 2020. Clover's shares were up 81.6% at $21.64 after earlier hitting a record high of $24.93. The company's options have drawn a surge of bullish action in recent days with trading volume surging to 587,000 contracts on Monday, compared with an average daily volume of under 50,000 contracts for the month of May, Trade Alert data showed.

2021-06-03T23:20:35.000Z,"AMC Looks to Issue 25 Million More Shares After 2,300% Rally","(Bloomberg) -- AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. is asking investors to authorize an additional 25 million new shares, aiming to capitalize on a rally that has sent the stock of the ailing movie-theater chain up about 2,300% this year. The proposal announced Thursday in a filing will be put to a vote at the company’s July 29 annual meeting. The equity today would be valued at $1.3 billion, though the company promised not to issue the new shares in 2021. “To successfully navigate the road ahead, we seek to assemble all of the financial tools that might help us,” Chief Executive Officer Adam Aron said in a statement. “An important tool for any company is having shares available to issue.” The request is perhaps unsurprising for a company that’s become the king of meme stocks, at the heart of a frenzy of online traders determine to pump up its valuation. Still, it’s a major retreat from a request earlier this year to authorize 500 million new shares. That proposal was originally up for a vote in May, but the annual meeting was postponed and the request withdrawn after it became clear investors would shoot it down. Read more: AMC Takes Traders on a Wild Ride, Pockets $587 Million Aron said in April the struggling company could issue about 43 million new shares. With sales of new stock totaling more than $800 million just this week, AMC has now completed nearly all of that authorization, according to the filing. In a YouTube interview Thursday, Aron said proceeds from another equity sale, if approved, would be used to reduce debt, help the company negotiate with landlords who are owed $400 million, and to chase acquisitions “hard.” ”It’s our view that we’re strengthening the company,” he said. “We’re not hurting the company.” (Updates with CEO’s comments from YouTube interview starting in penultimate paragraph.)

2021-06-08T10:36:25.000Z,Clover Health soars as 'meme stock' rally expandsReuters,"(Reuters) -Shares of Clover Health Investments Corp surged as much as 109% on Tuesday as it became a new focus for small individual traders on social media platforms who have prompted rallies in heavily shorted U.S. stocks this year. Medicare-backed insurance seller Clover was among the most shorted stocks across U.S. exchanges, with Clover being the target of a report by short seller Hindenburg in February, which took a position in the company. ""The WallStreetBets forum (on Reddit) has identified (stocks with) over 30% short interests,"" said Thomas Hayes, managing member at Great Hill Capital Llc in New York. The ""meme stock"" phenomenon, which began with video game retailer GameStop Corp in January and spread to cinema operator AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc in May, has prompted the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to say it was looking into signs of market manipulation. Short interest in Clover Health is at 49.10 million shares, or 43.5% of the float, Ihor Dusaniwsky, managing director of predictive analytics at S3 said on Tuesday. Short sellers were down $465 million in mark-to-market losses on Tuesday, based on a more than 80% price gain, which raised year-to-date losses to $517 million, he said. Shorts have been building their position in Clover Health as its stock price has been rallying, Dusaniwsky said. Clover's backer, venture capitalist Chamath Palihapitiya, took the company public through a $3.7 billion reverse merger with his blank check firm in October 2020. Clover's shares were up 81.6% at $21.64 after earlier hitting a record high of $24.93. The company's options have drawn a surge of bullish action in recent days with trading volume surging to 587,000 contracts on Monday, compared with an average daily volume of under 50,000 contracts for the month of May, Trade Alert data showed. Call options speculating on the stock climbing all the way to $30 were among some of the most heavily traded contracts in recent days.

Only the holders of these shares whose trades have settled as of June 2, 2021 are entitled to vote at the Shareholder Meeting. Trading or other transactions relating to the shares, such as share borrowing, derivatives (including options contracts) or short selling, do not impact the number of shares entitled to vote at the Shareholder Meeting. Advance voting for the Annual Shareholder meeting is expected to begin on June 16 and will continue through July 28. The details of proposals up for a vote and procedures for voting will be available in AMC’s proxy statement, a preliminary version of which is being filed today, with the definitive proxy statement expected to be filed on June 16. Shortly thereafter, the proxy and voting materials will be mailed or emailed to individual investors known to AMC, and to brokerage firms holding shares on behalf of investors in street name. Such investors are encouraged to reach out to their brokers in the latter part of June or early in July if proxy materials have not yet been forwarded to them by their brokers. The share count presented above includes those shares held by both domestic and international investors. AMC has been informed that certain international brokerage houses may restrict international investors’ ability to cast their votes. Affected international investors may wish to seek out other brokers who do facilitate shareholder voting for future elections. AMC expects to receive an approximate count of the number of individual shareholders whose trades have settled as of June 2 and will release this information as soon as it is available, which is currently anticipated to be no later than June 9. The Company does not record or have access to information regarding any share lending or short selling transactions other than what is publicly available from third party providers. AMC has received a number of inquiries regarding so-called synthetic shares and fake shares. AMC has no reliable information about this, therefore we can make no comment in this regard. AMC only maintains records regarding the shares it has legally issued and which are outstanding. The Company has received a number of inquiries regarding speculation about a potential split or reverse split of our stock. A stock split or reverse stock split is not a capital raising transaction and therefore does not achieve the aims of bolstering our liquidity or providing proceeds for other transactions. AMC has no plans to propose or take any actions regarding a stock split or reverse stock split, and in any event such actions would require shareholder approval. AMC understands that there is considerable trading in derivatives on the Company’s stock including both put and call options. These derivative securities can have the effect of increasing the volatility of AMC’s share price, and while they can be structured to replicate the economics of owning or short selling real AMC shares, they carry no voting rights.

2021-06-03T20:58:25.000Z,Explainer: What is a gamma squeeze and how did it drive up AMC's stock price?,"By Saqib Iqbal Ahmed    NEW YORK (Reuters) - Shares of AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc surged to a record high this week in a blistering rally that again highlighted how an arcane options market dynamic known as a gamma squeeze can super-charge stock price gains.    WHAT IS OPTIONS GAMMA?    AMC's rally was partly fueled by heavy trading of equity options. These financial derivatives give buyers the right to buy or sell shares at a fixed price in the future, depending on where the stock price is.    As the share price moves in the normal course of trading, the value of these derivatives fluctuates with the changing probability of the options buyer exerting that right.    These changes are captured through a range of mathematical calculations, one of which traders call a gamma.    Anyone who sells options is ""short gamma."" Gamma is highest when the strike price of the options sold is very close to that of the underlying stock.    WHAT IS A GAMMA SQUEEZE?    Market makers who sell options may ultimately have to deliver the underlying stock, so they risk heavy losses if they have to pay more than they bargained for.    To hedge their exposure, they often buy or sell shares of the underlying stock.    In the case of AMC, hordes of call options buyers left market makers with a massive short gamma position that grew as the share price inched closer to the high strike prices held by bullish investors.    As the share price skyrocketed, market makers bought AMC shares to offset their exposure, adding more fuel to the rally, analysts said. That is a gamma squeeze.    CAN GAMMA SQUEEZE WORK BOTH WAYS?    Yes. Market makers may be said to be short gamma from either selling calls or puts. When a stock is falling, market makers are highly motivated to sell the stock to hedge their exposure.    However, a downward squeeze on shares from gamma-induced selling is generally less extreme, compared with upwards buying pressure, analysts said.

2021-06-07T17:40:28.000Z,A meme stock’s downward spiral: GameStop’s 14-year Fortune 500 run comes to an endFortune,"Meme stocks are making your 401(k) returns look minuscule. Since the start of 2021, the S&P 500 index has climbed 12.6%—which, if the year ended now, would be an above-average annual return. But that pales in comparison to shares of [hotlink]GameStop[/hotlink] (ticker: GME)—the alpha dog in the meme stock space—which are up a staggering 1,218% during that same span. When members of the r/WallStreetBets subreddit started buying GME and other meme stocks, including companies like BlackBerry (+109%) and AMC (+2,160%), in January, it looked like a classic pump and dump. Or a joke, in their eyes, meant to damage some hedge funds (read: Melvin Capital) while retail investors made a quick buck. For these three stocks, in particular, the dump hasn’t come. But that doesn’t rule out a pullback. Indeed, the prices of many of these meme stocks are completely out of whack with fundamentals. Just how detached are meme stocks from reality? There’s no better example than GameStop. When the 2021 edition of the Fortune 500, a ranking of the 500 largest U.S. publicly traded companies by revenue, was published last week, it did not have GameStop on it. That marked the end of GameStop’s 14-year streak on the list—including a No. 464 placement last year. Falling off the Fortune 500 list is just one of many signs that GameStop’s business model is floundering. Back in the aughts, GameStop stores in shopping malls and strip malls were packed with teenagers looking to buy and trade in games for their Xboxes and GameCubes. But in the early 2010s, that brick-and-mortar model was disrupted by the digitization of the video game industry, as more gamers began downloading new titles rather than buying physical copies.

2021-06-08T10:36:25.000Z,Clover Health soars as 'meme stock' rally expandsReuters,"(Reuters) -Shares of Clover Health Investments Corp surged as much as 109% on Tuesday as it became a new focus for small individual traders on social media platforms who have prompted rallies in heavily shorted U.S. stocks this year. Medicare-backed insurance seller Clover was among the most shorted stocks across U.S. exchanges, with Clover being the target of a report by short seller Hindenburg in February, which took a position in the company. ""The WallStreetBets forum (on Reddit) has identified (stocks with) over 30% short interests,"" said Thomas Hayes, managing member at Great Hill Capital Llc in New York. The ""meme stock"" phenomenon, which began with video game retailer GameStop Corp in January and spread to cinema operator AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc in May, has prompted the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to say it was looking into signs of market manipulation. Short interest in Clover Health is at 49.10 million shares, or 43.5% of the float, Ihor Dusaniwsky, managing director of predictive analytics at S3 said on Tuesday. Short sellers were down $465 million in mark-to-market losses on Tuesday, based on a more than 80% price gain, which raised year-to-date losses to $517 million, he said. Shorts have been building their position in Clover Health as its stock price has been rallying, Dusaniwsky said. Clover's backer, venture capitalist Chamath Palihapitiya, took the company public through a $3.7 billion reverse merger with his blank check firm in October 2020. Clover's shares were up 81.6% at $21.64 after earlier hitting a record high of $24.93. The company's options have drawn a surge of bullish action in recent days with trading volume surging to 587,000 contracts on Monday, compared with an average daily volume of under 50,000 contracts for the month of May, Trade Alert data showed. Call options speculating on the stock climbing all the way to $30 were among some of the most heavily traded contracts in recent days.

2021-06-03T19:12:18.000Z,"Analysis: With AMC shares sky-high, 'gamma squeeze' less of a driving force","By Saqib Iqbal Ahmed    NEW YORK (Reuters) - The meteoric rise in shares of AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc may have diminished an important options market force that helped fuel its recent gains, analysts said.    Bullish options bets that would profit if AMC’s shares traded in the $40 to $70 range drew a huge influx of buying in recent days, with millions of contracts changing hands as the movie theater chain’s stock price rose by as much as 178% this week.    As AMC’s share price climbed, some of the market makers on the other side of the trade - typically large banks or financial institutions - were forced to buy AMC stock to hedge their risk. Leaving options unhedged would have exposed them to potentially severe losses as the stock climbed.    That buying helped push the share even higher in what is known as a gamma squeeze, analysts said. This options-related buying pressure had also been at play earlier this year when a combination of a short-squeeze and massive options trading had sent several so-called meme stocks soaring, most notably GameStop.    Now that many of those market makers have already hedged their exposure, that buying force is largely spent until new positions are opened, analysts said.    ""The gamma picture is different because the share price is much higher than the strikes where most of the gamma exists,"" said Jay Wolberg, founder of Trading Volatility, a data and analytics provider focused on financial derivatives.    Most AMC options contracts are clustered around the $20 to $40 level with open contracts thinning out above the $60 level. AMC was trading above $60 on Thursday.    In fact, Thursday's brief retreat in AMC's shares - when the stock fell as much as 40% on news of a second share issue in three days - may have been exacerbated by the very options dynamic that helped drive it higher earlier.

2021-06-03T18:51:00.000Z,AMC’s Bonds Soar From Virtually Worthless to Par in 7 Months,"(Bloomberg) -- AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc.’s debt is also getting a blockbuster boost from retail stock trading mania. AMC’s 12% second-lien bonds rose above their face value of 100 cents on the dollar Thursday, a stunning comeback from their low of just 5 cents on the dollar last November. The company’s debt rallied this week as credit investors cheered the latest rounds of equity financing, hoping the theater chain will use the new funds to help cut its borrowings. Proceeds from the 11.6 million of new shares AMC sold Thursday -- worth $587 million -- are earmarked for general corporate purposes, a catch-all term that can include activities like paying down debt or funding acquisitions. The cinema chain earlier this week issued equity worth $230 million in a private transaction with Mudrick Capital Management. The latest financing efforts, coupled with enthusiasm from day-traders on Reddit, have whipsawed the company’s stock price. “AMC is willing to take advantage of the hyper inflated share price to raise capital which is very positive for the credit,” Matt Zloto, co-head of high-yield research at CreditSights, said in an interview. The company “changed their narrative on what proceeds would likely be focused on to debt reduction from liquidity and M&A,” he said. AMC’s roughly $5 billion of debt, much of which carries risky CCC ratings, was trading at deeply distressed levels at the end of last year when the cinema chain was desperate for cash. Earlier share sales and January’s meme-stock rally helped the company shore up its financial position just as it was reopening theaters in major markets like New York and vaccinations became more widespread. Despite this week’s enthusiasm, creditors are signaling some caution about the future of the chain: AMC’s subordinated bonds due 2025 change hands at 81.5 cents, a level that typically signals some stress. Still, that’s up from a trading price of as low as 5.5 cents last year.   ",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amc-bonds-soar-virtually-worthless-185100024.html

Wendy’s jumped as much as 19% to notch a record as the fast-food restaurant operator gained traction on social media, including several touts on Reddit’s WallStreetBets forum. So-called meme stocks broadly gained Monday. Clover Health Investments Corp. also rallied as it was among the most mentioned companies in Stocktwits over the last day. The Chamath Palihapitiya-backed health insurer surged as much as 59%, the most ever, after Monday’s 32% advance. Clover Health short interest as a percentage of float is about 42%, data from financial analytics firm S3 Partners show. “The power of the network effect of social media entices more people to get involved, so then they start broadening their horizons, looking for other names that have high short interest and things like that,” said Michael O’Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading. GameStop Corp., the original icon among retail traders, surged as much as 21% to the highest in almost three months ahead of quarterly earnings results, which are expected Wednesday. MKM Partners analyst Eric Handler said in a note Tuesday that AMC should focus on debt reduction with its newly raised capital rather than acquisitions. He rates the stock sell with a $1 price target. “Management has been gifted an unforeseen opportunity from the recent wave of (fanatical) retail investor momentum, which has pushed the shares far above historical valuation levels,” Handler wrote. AMC company insiders have continued to take advantage of the stock’s run-up in price.

And then going forward, whatever it happens to be the hot area, because it's going to change over time, but to do it in a smarter way. So we're going to have the GameStops. We're going to have the AMCs. We're going to have some of the Bitcoin things and the blockchain things.

The S&P 500 ended little changed less than 6 points below its May 7 record close after fluctuating between gains and losses throughout the session. The 10-year Treasury yield fell to the lowest in a month, with focus turning toward Thursday’s consumer-price data that may offer clues on how far the Federal Reserve can postpone a tapering of stimulus. Megacap tech stocks including Amazon.com Inc., Apple Inc. and Alphabet Inc. helped prop up the benchmark index, which has gained 13% in 2021. Biotechs were among the biggest drags on Tuesday, a day after many of them rallied after Biogen Inc. received regulatory approval for its Alzheimer’s disease drug. Bitcoin slumped to a two-week low, with some analysts pointing to the recovery of Colonial Pipeline Co.’s ransom as evidence that crypto isn’t beyond government control. U.S. equities have traded in a relatively tight range around record highs in recent weeks as investors try to balance the economic recovery and a dovish Fed against inflation concerns, high valuations and disparities in global Covid vaccine rollouts. Volatility has returned to the market ahead of the CPI report and the Fed’s rate decision next Wednesday. “You look across the board and everything is more expensive,” said Brian Walsh, Jr., senior financial adviser at Walsh & Nicholson Financial Group. “It’s something we’re watching, but the Fed has continued to say they are gong to keep interest rates at bay regardless of the inflation data that comes in. You can only take them for their word and I think that’s what investors are doing.” Global equities also are near record highs, and Treasury yields have eased for three successive weeks.

Bullion steadied on Tuesday after rising 1.5% over the past two days as traders assessed a smaller-than-expected gain in U.S. payrolls as well as comments from Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen saying that higher interest rates would be a “plus” for America and the Fed, which weighed on the dollar. Gold is still holding close to $1,900 an ounce amid rising price pressures and speculation that central banks may eventually pare back stimulus as the global economy recovers from the pandemic. Thursday will bring the European Central Bank’s decision, as well as the U.S. CPI report which will be one of the last major economic indicators before the Fed’s next policy meeting June 15-16. “If financial markets are already in the summer doldrum mode, that could mean gold prices could steadily rally over the next couple of months,” said Edward Moya, a senior market analyst at Oanda Corp. “Even if the upcoming inflation report later this week doesn’t show a significant deceleration in pricing pressures, it probably won’t change anyone’s opinion on inflation at the Fed.

2021-06-07T09:30:56.000Z,How AMC is differentAxios,"AMC has learned its lesson from the meme winter, and is determined to use the meme summer to its advantage. That's the lesson from last week's wild action in AMC stock, much of which was orchestrated by the company itself. Why it matters: There's a case to be made that AMC only managed to avoid bankruptcy by getting caught up in the meme-stock craze of January, when its share price first became divorced from fundamentals. Get market news worthy of your time with Axios Markets. Subscribe for free. The company might not be able to make money by selling movie tickets, but it's proving itself a master of bringing in money by selling share certificates. How it works: AMC has steadily issued new stock, most recently on Thursday, when it sold more than 11 million shares in less than three hours, netting $587.4 million — more than the entire company's equity value at the beginning of the year. By the numbers: The total number of AMC Class A shares outstanding has risen tenfold from 50 million this time last year, to 500 million today. As a result, the company's market capitalization has risen even faster than its stratospheric share price. The big picture: When GameStop first started heading to the moon, the overwhelming consensus was that the stock had become a pure gambling vehicle that was inevitably going to crash, creating massive losses for people who bought into the hype. Those losses didn't happen: GameStop stock continues to trade at extremely elevated levels, raising the prospect that meme stocks can actually be (very risky) investments, rather than just short-term trades. Once meme stocks become a potential investment, companies can take advantage of that fact by issuing new shares on the capital market — just as other risky companies like Tesla have done in the past. The difference between Tesla and AMC is that AMC isn't a technology stock with the potential to dominate the world. It's just a chain of movie theaters, struggling in the face of a long-term secular decline in Americans' desire to see any but the very biggest movies outside the home.

See: AMC Files to Sell 11.5 Million Shares, Advises Investors Not to Buy as Stock Tumbles
Find: Musk’s ‘Baby Shark’ Tweet, Reddit Meme Stocks Redux & AMC Beach Banner Drive Market Frenzy — You Should Play It Cool The most recent increase was largely driven by a new rewards program that includes a free large popcorn. The day after reaching this new high, AMC announced plans to sell 11.55 million shares and sent the stock tumbling. The shares sold for an average of $50.85 and closed at $55 yesterday. The prices might not seem that wild considering other stocks sell for hundreds of dollars, but to put it into perspective, AMC increased 400% in the past month alone. Yahoo! Finance reports that Macquarie analysts have reconfirmed their $6 price target and neutral rating on AMC in early afternoon trading last Thursday. While there is optimism for a post-pandemic rebound for box-office in general, analysts remained concerned about the company’s balance sheet overall. For reference, the cost of a movie ticket at an AMC theater is about $14, making the company’s stock value less than half the cost of one of its tickets to see a film. It is not difficult to justify a drastically lower valuation compared to current market price. AMC’s best-ever full net profit earnings was in 2016, with $111.7 million — long before the pressures of COVID-19 brought the industry to a full stop. Business Service News reports that operating cash flow stagnated as the company was forced to spend more and borrow more to grow its sales. AMC’s current market capitalization of about $25 billion is 225 times the company’s best-ever net profit. In a year when movie theaters virtually shut down full operations due to a global pandemic, this just doesn’t make sense.  See: Watch Out for These Stock Sell Offs

2021-06-08T05:35:16.000Z,Meme Stocks Set To Extend Gains TuesdayInvesting.com,"By Dhirendra Tripathi Investing.com — Meme stocks, led by AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC), looked set to extend their gains for the second consecutive session rising 2%-5% in premarket Tuesday. The favorite of the Reddit gang, AMC, was up more than 4% while GameStop (NYSE:GME) and BlackBerry (NYSE:BB) gained approximately 2% and 3%, respectively. Meme stocks have defied the naysayers consistently over the last six months and while GameStop and Blackberry (TSX:BB) may be significantly off their year’s highs, it’s not been a flash in the pan. In the process, the stocks have made new highs several times and created wealth for many even as their books may not yet deserve those valuations. The companies are trying though. To the surprise of many, AMC has raised $1.24 billion in equity in three installments in less than a month, each at a different price, and proposes to sell 25 million more shares in 2022. GameStop, once a bankruptcy candidate, has reshuffled its top management as it tries to become a multichannel global retailer, retired part of its debt and created new facilities. Blackberry continues to strengthen its security software portfolio, have more cloud-based offerings and forge new partnerships.

2021-06-08T10:36:25.000Z,Clover Health soars as 'meme stock' rally expandsReuters,"(Reuters) -Shares of Clover Health Investments Corp surged as much as 109% on Tuesday as it became a new focus for small individual traders on social media platforms who have prompted rallies in heavily shorted U.S. stocks this year. Medicare-backed insurance seller Clover was among the most shorted stocks across U.S. exchanges, with Clover being the target of a report by short seller Hindenburg in February, which took a position in the company. ""The WallStreetBets forum (on Reddit) has identified (stocks with) over 30% short interests,"" said Thomas Hayes, managing member at Great Hill Capital Llc in New York. The ""meme stock"" phenomenon, which began with video game retailer GameStop Corp in January and spread to cinema operator AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc in May, has prompted the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to say it was looking into signs of market manipulation. Short interest in Clover Health is at 49.10 million shares, or 43.5% of the float, Ihor Dusaniwsky, managing director of predictive analytics at S3 said on Tuesday. Short sellers were down $465 million in mark-to-market losses on Tuesday, based on a more than 80% price gain, which raised year-to-date losses to $517 million, he said. Shorts have been building their position in Clover Health as its stock price has been rallying, Dusaniwsky said. Clover's backer, venture capitalist Chamath Palihapitiya, took the company public through a $3.7 billion reverse merger with his blank check firm in October 2020. Clover's shares were up 81.6% at $21.64 after earlier hitting a record high of $24.93. The company's options have drawn a surge of bullish action in recent days with trading volume surging to 587,000 contracts on Monday, compared with an average daily volume of under 50,000 contracts for the month of May, Trade Alert data showed. Call options speculating on the stock climbing all the way to $30 were among some of the most heavily traded contracts in recent days.

2021-06-03T17:57:04.000Z,This is no longer our grandparents' or parents' stock market: strategist,"Love it or hate it, the Meme Market is back, and Wall Street strategists say it can’t be ignored. While shares of AMC Entertainment (AMC) are having a volatile Thursday, the social-media-fueled trading frenzy has pushed shares of AMC up nearly 3,000% this year, giving the money-losing movie theater chain a market value of more than $30 billion. AMC is not alone. Shares of Bed, Bath & Beyond (BBBY), Express (EXPR), and BlackBerry (BB) are all up this year. It’s reminiscent of the eye-popping run-up in shares of Gamestop (GME) that we saw back in January, when the Reddit investing crowd bought shares of the struggling video game retailer to stick it to the Wall Street pros who were betting against the stock. Ryan Nauman, market strategist at Zephyr told Yahoo Finance Live that wild trading in these so-called meme stocks is not so much a “threat” to the broader market as it is a “learning experience.” “This is no longer our grandparents’, or for that matter, our parents' stock market,” Nauman said. “Now, investment professionals need to start focusing more on looking at alternative data sets, rethinking their investment thesis to consider this growing cohort of retail investors.” Even if you’ve vowed to stay away from the “meme trading madness,” you may own AMC and GameStop and not even know it, because the stocks are still part of the Vanguard Russell 2000 Value Index Fund ETF Shares (VTWV). The recent rallies in those two stocks have pushed the Russell 2000 Value Index up 30% year-to-date, dusting the Vanguard Russell 2000 Growth Index Fund ETF Shares' (VTWG) 3.8% gain during the same period. “These retail investors, because of day trading, and for the most part, because of this virtually free money that we've had from the Fed since the pandemic, their voice is getting much larger due to social media,” Nauman said. “They need to be considered when we are coming up with the investment thesis moving forward.”         ",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/this-is-no-longer-our-grandparents-or-parents-stock-market-strategist-175704670.html

Rhea Thomas, Wilmington Trust senior economist, and Jon Adams, BMO Global Asset Management senior investment strategist joined Yahoo Finance Live to discuss. [MUSIC PLAYING] SEANA SMITH: Got just around a minute and a half here until the closing bell. We have full coverage for you this afternoon. We have Rhea Thomas of Wilmington Trust, a senior economist there. We also Jon Adams, BMO's Global Asset Management Senior Investment Strategist. And let's take a look at where things stand here with just around a minute to go until the closing bell. We haven't seen a heck of a lot of movement in the final couple hours of trading. The Dow trending just along, now it's off 123 points, so bouncing back a little bit, just off its lows of the day. The S&P off just by a fraction here. It could still turn positive in the final minute of trading. NASDAQ on the other hand, holding onto gains. It has been the outperformer for the entire trading day. And now up just around a half of a percent. Taking a look at some of the individual movers in the markets today, looking over at the Dow, the worst performers in the Dow, Caterpillar, that stock off just around 2%. Merck and Dow Inc. are also among the biggest laggards there. UnitedHealth and Travelers rounding out the five worst performers in the Dow today. Taking a look at the sector action here, worst performer is materials. The XLB off just over 1%. We're also seeing some under-performers in financials and industrials. Flipping over though to what's outperforming, why we aren't seeing broader losses here today, real estate is the biggest outperformer today, with that sector up just around 1%. [BELL RINGING] Communication services and health care also holding on to gains. ADAM SHAPIRO: And there is the closing bell. When we get the gavel, we're going to see where these markets settle. As you heard Seana say, it appears that the Dow was pulling off of the session lows. But where it settles is going to be in the red. Right now, the Dow looks like it will settle around down 127 points. The S&P 500 off by about three points, NASDAQ will be up about 67 points.

2021-06-08T16:56:11.000Z,Don't expect a 'hot vax summer' for stocks: strategistYahoo Finance,"Stocks are grinding higher, with the S&P 500 (^GSPC) approaching record highs and the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) at the highest level in one month. But one Wall Street strategist is warning investors that the ""hot vax summer"" for stocks ""might feel a little cold and rocky."" Callie Cox, senior investment strategist at Ally Invest, explained on Yahoo Finance Live that the summer is a historically weak period for stocks. Volume typically trails off as investors leave the office and hit the roads.  ""[W]e could see lower volume in the stock market. And lower volume typically leads to a wandering market, especially with the environment we're in, where investors are kind of looking around the corner and saying, 'what's next? What's the ominous thing on the outlook?' And they're feeling a little more hesitant about putting their money in stocks,"" she said. This doesn't preclude market strength or necessarily mean we'll see weakness this summer. Cox pointed out that since 1990, the S&P 500 has risen an average of 0.9% between Memorial Day and Labor Day. But that compares to an average of 3.6% for the months before Memorial Day and 4.2% for the months after Labor Day. ""Stocks have bucked the trend recently, though, with five straight summers of gains (including the S&P 500’s 16% gains last summer). And the market’s path of least resistance is higher,"" she said.  Earlier this year, Cox told Yahoo Finance that year two of a new bull market typically sees more muted returns than those of the first year, which tend to be higher. Despite the general market strength, investors should still exercise caution. In a separate statement to Yahoo Finance, she writes, ""In a (relatively) low-volume environment, bad news tends to hit a hit harder, and small shifts in buying or selling could lead to noticeable market swings. Investors are extra skittish these days, too. We can tell the market’s mindset has changed from 'What could go right?' to 'What could go wrong?,' and that’s led to quick selling on surprise headlines.""

2021-06-03T17:30:21.000Z,AMC and Express Inc. Usher Golden Age for Retail-Focused Stock Sales,"(Bloomberg) -- Share sales that target retail traders are reaching new heights of popularity with the rise of money-hungry meme stocks like AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. AMC slumped as much as 40% on Thursday after announcing plans for another stock offering this week. This time, it’s an at-the-market offering, which deploys the historically unusual strategy of selling shares directly into the open market -- where retail traders had driven a 2,850% runup this year through Wednesday’s close. Express Inc., another day-trader favorite, fell as much as 26% on Thursday after announcing an at-the-market offering of its own. Traditional stock offerings are sold almost entirely to institutional investors, but the rise of retail trading is leading corporate issuers like these to cater their financings to whoever the buyers are. About $40 billion of at-the-market offerings have been announced this year in the U.S., according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That windfall is on pace for the biggest year ever, and it’s already surpassed the annual tally for every year on record except 2020, when retail trading ballooned during the thick of pandemic lockdowns. Meme stocks like Hertz Global Holdings Inc. and Tesla Inc. brought one at-the-market offering after another while their stocks rose even as the pandemic battered balance sheets. AMC announced its latest of several at-the-market offerings after the spread between the stock’s closing price on Wednesday and Wall Street’s average 12-month target rose to a record of 92%. That’s even steeper than the 76% spread for GameStop Corp. when it announced a record $1 billion at-the-market offering in April. Express was at a 37% premium to its consensus target. AMC’s rally has led to warnings about investing at these elevated levels -- perhaps the most dire one from the company itself. “We believe that the recent volatility and our current market prices reflect market and trading dynamics unrelated to our underlying business, or macro or industry fundamentals, and we do not know how long these dynamics will last,” the company said in a filing. “Under the circumstances, we caution you against investing in our Class A common stock, unless you are prepared to incur the risk of losing all or a substantial portion of your investment.”     ",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amc-express-inc-usher-golden-160121067.html
2021-06-03T17:25:03.000Z,Bed Bath & Beyond CEO Mark Tritton isn't getting sucked into meme stock mania,"This journalist remembers chatting on a number of occasions with Mark Tritton when he was the whiz kid behind Target's merchandising revival from 2016 to 2019.  Tritton — serving as Target's chief merchandising officer — was level-headed, decisive, creatively-focused and believed he could bring the cheap chic cool factor back to the discount retailer. He achieved his mission (Tritton remains a big reason why it's fun to shop at Target), and Target's bottom line continues to benefit from it to this day.  So I haven't been surprised to see Tritton run that same operational playbook since arriving as Bed Bath & Beyond's CEO (his first CEO job) in late 2019 to essentially save the home goods retailer from ruin.  Tritton quickly canned most of the terrible, long-tenured, under performing management team. He wasted no time to sell off non-core assets to raise a boatload of cash to fund a turnaround. He laid out long-term financial targets to Wall Street, and is delivering on them in a very volatile retail backdrop. Meanwhile, he is aggressively remodeling stores and totally overhauling the merchandise in them in a bid to regain customer loyalty.  Over time, Bed Bath & Beyond shareholders will likely be rewarded for these careful, well thought out efforts. Up to this point they have been: Bed Bath's stock has surged 155% since Tritton was named CEO on October 9, 2019. Worth noting, shares of Tritton's former employer Target are up 104% over that timespan.  Having said all of that, it's really no surprise I found Tritton keeping things in perspective at about 12:30 p.m. on June 2, 2021 in an interview on Yahoo Finance Live. Tritton stepped to the mic (remotely, still) as his stock price was up more than 40%, swept up once again into the meme stock mania being churned up by an army of retail traders.  ""I think today's activities are just a day in time. It doesn't affect us operationally. We are focused and ready,"" Tritton said. ""Regardless of the stock movement our role is to create sequential growth and strength at both the balance sheet and in growth ratios. We believe we have been doing that.""

2021-06-07T17:40:28.000Z,A meme stock’s downward spiral: GameStop’s 14-year Fortune 500 run comes to an endFortune,"Meme stocks are making your 401(k) returns look minuscule. Since the start of 2021, the S&P 500 index has climbed 12.6%—which, if the year ended now, would be an above-average annual return. But that pales in comparison to shares of [hotlink]GameStop[/hotlink] (ticker: GME)—the alpha dog in the meme stock space—which are up a staggering 1,218% during that same span. When members of the r/WallStreetBets subreddit started buying GME and other meme stocks, including companies like BlackBerry (+109%) and AMC (+2,160%), in January, it looked like a classic pump and dump. Or a joke, in their eyes, meant to damage some hedge funds (read: Melvin Capital) while retail investors made a quick buck. For these three stocks, in particular, the dump hasn’t come. But that doesn’t rule out a pullback. Indeed, the prices of many of these meme stocks are completely out of whack with fundamentals. Just how detached are meme stocks from reality? There’s no better example than GameStop. When the 2021 edition of the Fortune 500, a ranking of the 500 largest U.S. publicly traded companies by revenue, was published last week, it did not have GameStop on it. That marked the end of GameStop’s 14-year streak on the list—including a No. 464 placement last year. Falling off the Fortune 500 list is just one of many signs that GameStop’s business model is floundering. Back in the aughts, GameStop stores in shopping malls and strip malls were packed with teenagers looking to buy and trade in games for their Xboxes and GameCubes. But in the early 2010s, that brick-and-mortar model was disrupted by the digitization of the video game industry, as more gamers began downloading new titles rather than buying physical copies. GameStop’s revenue, which peaked at $9.6 billion in 2012, had fallen to $6.5 billion by fiscal year 2020. Then the pandemic took it down another notch. During its 2021 fiscal year, which ran through Jan. 31, GameStop sales totaled $5.1 billion. Since 2012, its sales are down 47%.

The stock -- like GameStop Corp. before it -- has become a darling of retail traders. The movie-theater chain’s wild rise comes despite questionable fundamentals, prompting concerns among regulators that investors could be sitting on substantial losses if the stock plunges. The SEC has already said it’s investigating what happened with GameStop in January, with a focus on whether traders were using online message boards to dupe other investors into buying into the rally.

Yesterday, we had a market strategist from Zephyr on who said, you know, like it or not, these retail investors who are sending some of these stocks into the stratosphere cannot and should not be ignored. What's your take on that? BRIAN JACOBSEN: Well, yeah, on my team, we agree. I mean, monitoring liquidity in markets, and seeing if there is excessive shorting of stocks, and seeing if there's going to be some sort of short squeeze-- to me, that's just sort of basics when it comes to portfolio management and trying to decide when it is that you're going to enter or exit a position. A lot of the portfolio managers that we work with, especially in the small cap space, were talking about how it is that over the last few months, because of the meme trade, that they've actually been able to take profits and exit some positions with some decent gains for our shareholders. And so they are a force to be reckoned with. But also keep in mind that what the swarm gives, they can also take, as you see with some of the volatility here. And so sometimes if the price moves and it's not an informational move, it might actually be prudent to take some profits on that. KRISTIN MYERS: So, then, it sounds like, Brian, you're saying that despite the fact that so many people are saying that, frankly, this is gambling, it's just out and out speculation, that there is money that you would be leaving on the table if you don't get involved in some of these trades with AME-- or AMC, excuse me, or GameStop, or Bed Bath and Beyond, or some of the others?

ALEXIS CHRISTOFOROUS: I want to continue our discussion on the markets now and bring in Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National. Art, good to see you. I want to stick with these meme stocks and the fact that a lot of investors might not even know they own these stocks because they're part of the Russell 2000 Small Cap Value Index. I'm talking about AMC and GameStop among them. What do regular investors who don't want to play the meme game need to know about what's going on in that space right now? ART HOGAN: Yeah, it's such a great question, Alexis. And I think that-- I think you and Jared hit it right in the last section, where he said it's its own animal. And you said it's a frenzy, right? So understand that that's what's going on right now. It's a separate sideshow. It is its own animal. It is a frenzy. It's a mania. But if you are along the Russell 2000, the IWM, part of the movement you've seen in the Russell 2000 has been because of companies like AMC and GameStop. And that will continue to be the case until they reconstitute that index. And actually, these names are going to get kicked out because they're too large. This is the function of if they're going to be put into the Russell 1,000, right? So that's what happens once a year, where it just so happens that that's happening this month. But in the near term, understand that if there's a handful of meme stocks that are rotating in and out of favor, it could have a potential move on the Russell 2000. But understand very small, the percentage that AMC or GameStop, back in the day when GameStop was the only game in town. In meme land, I think that that had a bit of a move on the Russell, too. But I think the Russell, too, really has been driven. Because it's domestically focused, focused on the US economy. Small cap tend to be cyclical. There's a lot of energy and financials in there. So I think there's a lot more fundamental drivers for the Russell 2000 right now versus that poll that has been the meme stock frenzy.

Rhea Thomas, Wilmington Trust senior economist, and Jon Adams, BMO Global Asset Management senior investment strategist joined Yahoo Finance Live to discuss. [MUSIC PLAYING] SEANA SMITH: Got just around a minute and a half here until the closing bell. We have full coverage for you this afternoon. We have Rhea Thomas of Wilmington Trust, a senior economist there. We also Jon Adams, BMO's Global Asset Management Senior Investment Strategist. And let's take a look at where things stand here with just around a minute to go until the closing bell. We haven't seen a heck of a lot of movement in the final couple hours of trading. The Dow trending just along, now it's off 123 points, so bouncing back a little bit, just off its lows of the day. The S&P off just by a fraction here. It could still turn positive in the final minute of trading. NASDAQ on the other hand, holding onto gains. It has been the outperformer for the entire trading day. And now up just around a half of a percent. Taking a look at some of the individual movers in the markets today, looking over at the Dow, the worst performers in the Dow, Caterpillar, that stock off just around 2%. Merck and Dow Inc. are also among the biggest laggards there. UnitedHealth and Travelers rounding out the five worst performers in the Dow today. Taking a look at the sector action here, worst performer is materials. The XLB off just over 1%. We're also seeing some under-performers in financials and industrials. Flipping over though to what's outperforming, why we aren't seeing broader losses here today, real estate is the biggest outperformer today, with that sector up just around 1%. [BELL RINGING] Communication services and health care also holding on to gains. ADAM SHAPIRO: And there is the closing bell. When we get the gavel, we're going to see where these markets settle. As you heard Seana say, it appears that the Dow was pulling off of the session lows. But where it settles is going to be in the red. Right now, the Dow looks like it will settle around down 127 points. The S&P 500 off by about three points, NASDAQ will be up about 67 points.

2021-06-03T16:56:23.000Z,AMC stock is worth less than a movie ticket: analyst,"Wall Street pros continue to come out in force to remind retail traders of going all in right now on meme stock favorite AMC Entertainment (AMC).  Macquarie analyst Chad Beynon and his team reiterated their $6 price target (the cost of one ticket at an AMC theater is about $14) and Neutral rating on AMC in early afternoon trading Thursday. While the group commended AMC CEO Adam Aron for his embrace of the enthusiastic retail trading community and voiced optimism on a box office recovery post-pandemic, the analysts remain concerned about the company's balance sheet.  ""Despite shares now up 2,850% year-to-date (as of 6/2 close) vs. the S&P 500 of 12%, AMC balance sheet is still hampered by nearly $5.5 billion of debt as of the end of 1Q21 and our projected leverage of 12.3x by year end 2022. AMC, the largest global player (945 theaters) should benefit from the rebound in theatre demand, which is urgently needed in order for the company to address deferred rent ($450 million+), maintenance capex (~$100 million), and high annual interest (~$420 million),"" said the note. The analyst team sees AMC losing nearly $2.5 billion from 2021 to 2023 on an adjusted operating profit basis. But, the note added the financial estimates are ""under review."" AMC shares crashed 31% Thursday after a nearly 100% surge on Wednesday amid a renewed appetite among retail traders for meme stocks. The stock's pullback on Thursday follows a disclosure by AMC that it will issue 11.5 million new shares — as Aron looks to capitalize on the stock's latest surge — to raise money to fund various corporate initiatives.  The stock was sent back into overdrive on Tuesday, as the company — which like other meme names has weak fundamentals for a myriad of reasons — unveiled an 8.5 million share sale. The company fetched $230.5 million in the sale to investor Mudrick Capital (which then reportedly sold the stake, saying the stock was overvalued).

2021-06-07T17:40:28.000Z,A meme stock’s downward spiral: GameStop’s 14-year Fortune 500 run comes to an endFortune,"Meme stocks are making your 401(k) returns look minuscule. Since the start of 2021, the S&P 500 index has climbed 12.6%—which, if the year ended now, would be an above-average annual return. But that pales in comparison to shares of [hotlink]GameStop[/hotlink] (ticker: GME)—the alpha dog in the meme stock space—which are up a staggering 1,218% during that same span. When members of the r/WallStreetBets subreddit started buying GME and other meme stocks, including companies like BlackBerry (+109%) and AMC (+2,160%), in January, it looked like a classic pump and dump. Or a joke, in their eyes, meant to damage some hedge funds (read: Melvin Capital) while retail investors made a quick buck. For these three stocks, in particular, the dump hasn’t come. But that doesn’t rule out a pullback. Indeed, the prices of many of these meme stocks are completely out of whack with fundamentals. Just how detached are meme stocks from reality? There’s no better example than GameStop. When the 2021 edition of the Fortune 500, a ranking of the 500 largest U.S. publicly traded companies by revenue, was published last week, it did not have GameStop on it. That marked the end of GameStop’s 14-year streak on the list—including a No. 464 placement last year. Falling off the Fortune 500 list is just one of many signs that GameStop’s business model is floundering. Back in the aughts, GameStop stores in shopping malls and strip malls were packed with teenagers looking to buy and trade in games for their Xboxes and GameCubes. But in the early 2010s, that brick-and-mortar model was disrupted by the digitization of the video game industry, as more gamers began downloading new titles rather than buying physical copies. GameStop’s revenue, which peaked at $9.6 billion in 2012, had fallen to $6.5 billion by fiscal year 2020. Then the pandemic took it down another notch. During its 2021 fiscal year, which ran through Jan. 31, GameStop sales totaled $5.1 billion. Since 2012, its sales are down 47%.

2021-06-08T10:36:25.000Z,Clover Health soars as 'meme stock' rally expandsReuters,"(Reuters) -Shares of Clover Health Investments Corp surged as much as 109% on Tuesday as it became a new focus for small individual traders on social media platforms who have prompted rallies in heavily shorted U.S. stocks this year. Medicare-backed insurance seller Clover was among the most shorted stocks across U.S. exchanges, with Clover being the target of a report by short seller Hindenburg in February, which took a position in the company. ""The WallStreetBets forum (on Reddit) has identified (stocks with) over 30% short interests,"" said Thomas Hayes, managing member at Great Hill Capital Llc in New York. The ""meme stock"" phenomenon, which began with video game retailer GameStop Corp in January and spread to cinema operator AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc in May, has prompted the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to say it was looking into signs of market manipulation. Short interest in Clover Health is at 49.10 million shares, or 43.5% of the float, Ihor Dusaniwsky, managing director of predictive analytics at S3 said on Tuesday. Short sellers were down $465 million in mark-to-market losses on Tuesday, based on a more than 80% price gain, which raised year-to-date losses to $517 million, he said. Shorts have been building their position in Clover Health as its stock price has been rallying, Dusaniwsky said. Clover's backer, venture capitalist Chamath Palihapitiya, took the company public through a $3.7 billion reverse merger with his blank check firm in October 2020. Clover's shares were up 81.6% at $21.64 after earlier hitting a record high of $24.93. The company's options have drawn a surge of bullish action in recent days with trading volume surging to 587,000 contracts on Monday, compared with an average daily volume of under 50,000 contracts for the month of May, Trade Alert data showed. Call options speculating on the stock climbing all the way to $30 were among some of the most heavily traded contracts in recent days.

2021-06-03T16:25:13.000Z,AMC Stock Sale Comes With Warning to Traders: Be Prepared to Lose It All,"(Bloomberg) -- Investing in AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. comes with the promise of free popcorn, special screenings -- and the chance you’ll lose all your money. That last part is a warning the movie chain and its lawyers made in a regulatory filing on Thursday announcing its intention to sell more than 11 million shares to a market dominated by frenzied retail traders. While companies commonly use cautionary language when making share offerings, the extent of AMC’s was uncommon. It included an acknowledgment that the stock is at the mercy of the retail mania, with fundamentals playing little role in determining valuation. “We believe that the recent volatility and our current market prices reflect market and trading dynamics unrelated to our underlying business, or macro or industry fundamentals, and we do not know how long these dynamics will last,” AMC said in its filing Thursday. “Under the circumstances, we caution you against investing in our Class A common stock, unless you are prepared to incur the risk of losing all or a substantial portion of your investment.” The movie-theater chain revealed that it plans to capitalize on the rally by selling up to 11.55 million shares to trim its debt load and finance future acquisitions. The tone in Thursday’s filing is starkly different than the one in its announcement a day earlier, when it said it would offer retail shareholders special perks as a reward for their loyalty. It’s “very unusual,” said Lawrence Creatura, a fund manager at PRSPCTV Capital LLC. “But, a statement of the obvious. It’s like saying, ‘Be careful when you go cliff diving because there is this force called gravity, and you might get hurt.’” Shares of AMC plunged more than 30% as trading kicked off on Thursday, triggering a halt. They’re are still up more than 2,000% since the beginning of the year. This would be the company’s fourth stock sale of 2021. It sold shares this week to Mudrick Capital, which flipped them on the same day for a profit.      ",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amc-stock-sale-comes-warning-145548354.html

MYLES UDLAND: But let's begin our coverage this morning of the market with the story that remains the story. See it there? I love that animation. Meme madness in the market here. AMC, GameStop, of course really the two leading-- we'll call them the leading members of this act, this play, leading cast members of this performance we see happening in the market. But this morning, really, the chaos continues to spread. Wendy's the latest name to get involved. There's now a fast food angle to the stay-at-home trade. If we go all the way back in time to February of 2020, when Wallstreetbets first really became a driving force of conversation around the stock market-- so this was just on the eve of when the market's concern turned to full COVID all the time. We had a big ""Bloomberg Businessweek"" story about getting tendies and about buying call options. YOLO call options really were birthed with that story. Luke Kawa over at Bloomberg writing that. Luke, unfortunately, has since moved on to the dark side, asset management. But we have seen with Wendy's this morning, guys, literal tendies. Their nuggets are excellent, the spicy nuggets, of course. Don't get the regular ones. That's all in the market. And at this point, I mean, where do we begin? Sozzi, let's start with you because you actually cover Wendy's as a fundamental story. Do you have any updates for us there? Anything that we can point to on this? Or is it just the latest ticker to get Redditized here in this market? BRIAN SOZZI: Well, first off, yes, that is in fact correct. Wendy's got, what they say, touted on the Reddit stream early this morning. Also had my former boss Jim Cramer out there, doing his thing, touting Wendy's as well. But I hate to be the bearer of bad news here. But to the meme traders, there's actually a fundamental story to Wendy's. And they're coming off a pretty good first quarter a couple of weeks ago. I talked to CEO Todd Penegor. He tells me they are looking to go from 8,000 restaurants by 2025 from about 7,000 now, a billion-dollar-plus breakfast business probably over the next year.

2021-06-03T15:28:57.000Z,AMC embracing retail investors is 'rational': Strategist,"Interactive Brokers Chief Strategist Steve Sosnick joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss the latest outlook for meme stocks as AMC files to sell 11 million shares. - Let's bring in our first guest for the hour. We've got Steve Sosnick, Interactive Broker's chief strategist. Steve, I know you've been following this one really closely. There seems to be two camps here. You know, on the one hand you've got a company like AMC sort of acknowledging the wild swings they've seen in their stock, but addressing the retail traders through their program to try and keep the communication going. And then the others who say, this is just simply too risky because the fundamentals do not bear out the price it's trading at right now. How do you see the action? STEVE SOSNICK: Well, Akiko, that's a tricky, complex question. I think at some level you have both. I mean, I wrote a piece yesterday basically saying that it was clear that AMC was embracing the meme, and that it was thoroughly rational for them to do so. Because here you have a company that has billions of dollars in indebtedness. They-- you know, they suffered a huge hit during COVID, which we all understand, but prior to COVID they weren't making much money either. They had-- you know, they were more or less around flat line of earnings. They'd make money some quarters, give back money some others. The same with their cash flows. It's not a company that investors really would cater to in terms of that steady sort of income and cash flow growth that you would expect or want. So what can you do to get out of the situation you're in, with debt that's still trading, you know-- you know, basically with interest rates of 8% to 12%. The bond market's telling you, this is not a great company. And bond traders don't get caught up in hype the same way. They really only care about getting paid back, not about, you know, wild upside and volatility. And so I think that AMC said, we're going to embrace this. Bed Bath and Beyond, he's got a different point of view. But like it or not, all the meme stocks are sort of wrapped up in this weird thematic trade, you know, them and cryptos. And I think you see rotation.                 ",https://finance.yahoo.com/video/amc-embracing-retail-investors-rational-152857322.html
2021-06-08T14:02:06.000Z,Investors are sticking with recovery stocks: strategistYahoo Finance Video,"Jeffrey Kleintop, Chief Global Investment Strategist at Charles Schwab, joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss the outlook for the stock market and global economy. MYLES UDLAND: All right, welcome back to Yahoo Finance Live. Just about three minutes away from the opening bell on this Tuesday morning as we get set to wrap up the second quarter here, taking stock of where the global economy has come in the last year and where it might go for the balance of 2021. Joining us now to discuss is Jeffrey Kleintop. He's the Chief Global Investment Strategist over at Charles Schwab. So Jeff, you guys are out with your mid-year outlook. And I'm just curious how you guys are characterizing kind of this phase, this moment in the cycle. JEFFREY KLEINTOP: It's been an amazing economic recovery. I mean, we're all aware of it. But we may not be aware of the strength. I mean, to have an entire recession-- a deep one-- and a recovery all contained within five quarters has never happened before. And if the IMF is right and we get our 6% growth globally here in 2021, it's the fastest pace of growth since 1973. That kind of economic momentum has really led cyclicals to outperform this year. We think that continues in the second half. It's also caused a leadership shift from the US to Europe, where the more economically sensitive companies lie. We've seen Europe outperform so far this year. I think that's something that may also continue in part two of this year. BRIAN SOZZI: Jeff, it doesn't sound like you're too concerned about inflation. JEFFREY KLEINTOP: Well, certainly, inflation is a bigger risk than it's been in a long time. And inflation is likely to run higher in this cycle than it did in the last one. But already, we're starting to see signs that the momentum to inflation is starting to fade. Commodity prices have come down over the course of the last month, thanks in part to China really putting on the brakes. We've also seen supply chains get a little bit better. I like to watch port traffic. And if you take a look at the Port of Los Angeles, the biggest and most congested port in the world, we've gone from 40 ships waiting to unload their 40-foot unit-- 40-foot container ship units back in first quarter to about 30 ships waiting about a month ago to, I think I counted about 20 ships this morning. So that's, you know, things are getting unloaded, getting to their destinations, reducing the shortages that put at risk production or jobs tied to those supply chain disruptions. So I think we're getting a little bit better incrementally on the inflation front. And worries about a premature tightening, I think, are fading away.

2021-06-03T15:20:44.000Z,UK investors at risk as Brits pile into meme stock AMC,"UK investors have been piling into so-called meme stocks such as AMC (AMC) and Blackberry (BB) this week, despite being warned about high risks. According to figures from British trading company Freetrade, buy orders for AMC are up almost 300% on the week, and it is the most traded stock on the platform. Meanwhile, more than 63% of all new trades executed by UK traders on Capital.com in the past two weeks have been in financial derivatives linked to shares in AMC.  This is a significant jump from just 23% last month. Capital added that more than 82% of UK clients this week took a long position in the so-called meme stock. AMC was also the most purchased share on Hargreaves Lansdown, the biggest retail investment platform in the UK, over the past week with GameStop (GME) following closely behind.  It comes as AMC warned investors on Thursday not to ""buy our stock right now"", sending the price down as much as 30% before it pared back some losses. In a filing it said: ""We believe that the recent volatility and our current market prices reflect market and trading dynamics unrelated to our underlying business, or macro or industry fundamentals, and we do not know how long these dynamics will last. ""Under the circumstances, we caution you against investing in our Class A common stock, unless you are prepared to incur the risk of losing all or a substantial portion of your investment."" On Wednesday the cinema chain closed 95% higher on the day at $62.55 (£44.32), bringing its year-to-date gains to more than 3,000%. As of Wednesday’s close AMC had a market cap of $28bn, surpassing that of Delta Air Lines (DAL) and GameStop, the latter of which also joined the rally. Shares of Bed, Bath and Beyond (BBBY), Express (EXPR) and Koss (KOSS), which are all heavily shorted by Wall Street’s elite, were also caught up in the retail frenzy, all of which saw their share price rise more than 30% during the session.

2021-06-07T09:30:56.000Z,How AMC is differentAxios,"AMC has learned its lesson from the meme winter, and is determined to use the meme summer to its advantage. That's the lesson from last week's wild action in AMC stock, much of which was orchestrated by the company itself. Why it matters: There's a case to be made that AMC only managed to avoid bankruptcy by getting caught up in the meme-stock craze of January, when its share price first became divorced from fundamentals. Get market news worthy of your time with Axios Markets. Subscribe for free. The company might not be able to make money by selling movie tickets, but it's proving itself a master of bringing in money by selling share certificates. How it works: AMC has steadily issued new stock, most recently on Thursday, when it sold more than 11 million shares in less than three hours, netting $587.4 million — more than the entire company's equity value at the beginning of the year. By the numbers: The total number of AMC Class A shares outstanding has risen tenfold from 50 million this time last year, to 500 million today. As a result, the company's market capitalization has risen even faster than its stratospheric share price. The big picture: When GameStop first started heading to the moon, the overwhelming consensus was that the stock had become a pure gambling vehicle that was inevitably going to crash, creating massive losses for people who bought into the hype. Those losses didn't happen: GameStop stock continues to trade at extremely elevated levels, raising the prospect that meme stocks can actually be (very risky) investments, rather than just short-term trades. Once meme stocks become a potential investment, companies can take advantage of that fact by issuing new shares on the capital market — just as other risky companies like Tesla have done in the past. The difference between Tesla and AMC is that AMC isn't a technology stock with the potential to dominate the world. It's just a chain of movie theaters, struggling in the face of a long-term secular decline in Americans' desire to see any but the very biggest movies outside the home.

2021-06-07T09:30:56.000Z,How AMC is differentAxios,"AMC has learned its lesson from the meme winter, and is determined to use the meme summer to its advantage. That's the lesson from last week's wild action in AMC stock, much of which was orchestrated by the company itself. Why it matters: There's a case to be made that AMC only managed to avoid bankruptcy by getting caught up in the meme-stock craze of January, when its share price first became divorced from fundamentals. Get market news worthy of your time with Axios Markets. Subscribe for free. The company might not be able to make money by selling movie tickets, but it's proving itself a master of bringing in money by selling share certificates. How it works: AMC has steadily issued new stock, most recently on Thursday, when it sold more than 11 million shares in less than three hours, netting $587.4 million — more than the entire company's equity value at the beginning of the year. By the numbers: The total number of AMC Class A shares outstanding has risen tenfold from 50 million this time last year, to 500 million today. As a result, the company's market capitalization has risen even faster than its stratospheric share price. The big picture: When GameStop first started heading to the moon, the overwhelming consensus was that the stock had become a pure gambling vehicle that was inevitably going to crash, creating massive losses for people who bought into the hype. Those losses didn't happen: GameStop stock continues to trade at extremely elevated levels, raising the prospect that meme stocks can actually be (very risky) investments, rather than just short-term trades. Once meme stocks become a potential investment, companies can take advantage of that fact by issuing new shares on the capital market — just as other risky companies like Tesla have done in the past. The difference between Tesla and AMC is that AMC isn't a technology stock with the potential to dominate the world. It's just a chain of movie theaters, struggling in the face of a long-term secular decline in Americans' desire to see any but the very biggest movies outside the home.

2021-06-07T14:20:37.000Z,"AMC, other 'meme' stocks jump; regulator signals concernReuters","By Aaron Saldanha, Sinéad Carew and David Randall (Reuters) -Shares of AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc and other ""meme stocks"" jumped on Monday, extending a rally in social-media favorites into a third week as message boards hummed with talk of squeezing Wall Street short-sellers. The sharp gains prompted the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to say it was looking into signs of market manipulation given the ""volatility in certain stocks."" The volatility has challenged analysts, and two of them in the past week have stopped covering video game retailer GameStop, whose shares soared in January in a retail-driven rally. Cinema operator AMC jumped almost 15%, putting its gain over the past five sessions at 111%. BlackBerry's U.S. listing surged 14% and is now up 57% since the start of June. ""AMC never ceases to amaze me. Just when I think that train is over, it jumps almost 10 points in the first 30 min of trading,"" one poster on Reddit wrote. AMC shares are up about 2,500% in 2021 as the company has courted individual investors, while GameStop has surged over 1,300% year to date. Some bearish investors retreated from bets against AMC on Friday. Short interest slumped to 74.5 million shares, or 14.9% of AMC's float, from 88.2 million on Thursday, according to S3 Partners. Clover Health Investments, which has been the target of short sellers, was one of the most mentioned stocks on Reddit's wallstreetbets on Monday, with some users suggesting the shares as the forum's next short-squeeze target. The insurer's shares soared 32% in their highest volume trading day since April 19. Institutional investors are largely sitting on the sidelines as the meme-stock rally continues. Amateur investors, however, ""don't need a reason,"" said Michael O'Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading in Stamford, Connecticut. ""They're trying to do the same thing they did last week.

JULIE HYMAN: Let's talk about tech stocks. Let's talk about momentum and what's been going on in this market. Binky Chadha. Is joining us now, chief global strategist at Deutsche Bank. Binky, it's great to see you. I want to get into tech stocks. But first, I mean, I got to spare a word for the memes, I suppose, this morning. And at your level-- because I know you're thinking about all of this as a very high level, sector by sector. But how are you thinking about the meme stocks, if at all? Are you getting questions from clients? Are you thinking about them as an asset class? How is all of this factoring into your work? BINKY CHADHA: Hi, Julie. Good morning. And thanks for having me on. You know, we think basically-- and this is not a new view. Basically, we've thought that since the bottom in the equity markets last March, you know, the role of the retail investor more broadly, basically, has been absolutely key to, you know, driving the market, explaining its resilience, explaining elevated vol. Because a lot of the participation is basically happening through the options market. But you know, our view has basically been that this is all really about-- if you want to call it that-- immobility at home and working from home leads to, basically, trading from home. This has been happening in the US, but it's also been happening elsewhere across the world. And I think, you know, one of the most striking things that you want to keep in mind is that basically the participation of the retail investor in US equities has been very, very closely followed-- of course, inversely the COVID timeline. So one of my favorite charts is looking at an Apple mobility index, looking at the Apple mobility index for the US. You know, you invert it, and you overlay whatever your favorite measure of retail participation in equities is. I have two, whether you take basically the call volume of small traders, or you look at the net open bullish position of small traders. And there is a very striking correlation. So I would argue that the participation is following the script and the thesis that, as markets reopen, retail participation is going to come down.

2021-06-07T15:27:11.000Z,G7 finance ministers reach global minimum corporate tax dealYahoo Finance Video,"G7 finance ministers have reached a global minimum corporate tax deal. EY Global Vice Chair of Tax Kate Barton joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss. AKIKO FUJITA: For some more analysis on this, let's bring in our first guest for the hour. We've got Kate Barton, EY global vice chair of tax. Kate, it's good to talk to you today. When you think back to Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen initially sort of putting this idea on the table, she discussed this in the context of ending the race to the bottom, as she described it. If we're talking about a 15% floor here on corporate taxes, to what extent does that resolve the issue? KATE BARTON: Well, it's definitely a big step. I mean, there are a lot of countries around the world that will have to increase their tax rate if this, in fact, goes forward. The devil is going to be in the detail because do you just look at the federal tax rate, or do you look at the state or the state equivalent in countries around the world, like cantons and the like? But there are a number of countries, for example Ireland, which has got a 12 and 1/2 percent rate, which has been a longtime part of the tax policy, where they've taxed corporations at a lower rate and then have really taxed their wage-earners at a higher rate. And that's always been something that they felt like has fueled their economy. So countries have competed, really, on their headline rate. And so this will change that game. ZACK GUZMAN: I mean, when it comes to that, obviously, some countries have even used it to their advantage, as you're describing there. So how does it maybe benefit some? What are the ones that stand to benefit the most here or lose the most if this is to kind of become the way things are done? KATE BARTON: Well, this is just the start. The global minimum rate is important. But then it's all how the country, the headquarters countries taxes. And so in the US, we have worldwide taxation still. And it is important for that global minimum tax to sort of fit together, if you will, through foreign tax credits and the normal corporate rate.

In the same SEC filing, the movie chain also cautioned “against investing” in its common stock, unless investors “are prepared to incur the risk of losing all or a substantial portion” of their investment. JULIE HYMAN: But first, we got to talk about AMC, don't we? The company out with a surprise filing this morning, saying it's going to be selling 11 and 1/2 million additional shares, registering to sell them. But what really stood out to us, of course, from this filing was the language within it, and this quote in particular. ""Under the circumstances,"" reads the filing, ""we caution you against investing in our class A common stock, unless you're prepared to incur the risk of losing all or a substantial portion of your investment."" Now, it's not unusual to see sort of caveats, legalese in these types of filings. But even by those standards, this is fairly extraordinary. Here's a bunch more shares to buy. But you might not want to actually do that-- is an interesting move to take. Again, legally, I understand why they have to say it. But it's still pretty stark, Myles, when they actually do. MYLES UDLAND: Yeah. And you know, in addition to that-- and I would encourage viewers who are interested-- and I'm sure many already have-- I would encourage them to go read the rest of the filing. Because there are one, two, three, four, five additional bullet points of caveats on crazy things that have happened with shares of AMC and that may or may not happen to shares of AMC in the future. But again, I think it's quite a shrewd move here on the part of management to come to market for the second time in a week when you have this kind of action in your shares. And you know, I just put a post up on Yahoo Finance that a lot of the AMC bulls think is wrong. They're telling me to read the filing. I tell you to read the filing. The filing says there are 11 and 1/2 million new shares that can be issued. It is under the April prospectus, which has thus been amended today to include the additional shares. The 43 million shares they filed to sell in April, that sale was completed in May at, I believe, $9.94 per share or something like that.

See: AMC Files to Sell 11.5 Million Shares, Advises Investors Not to Buy as Stock Tumbles
Find: Musk’s ‘Baby Shark’ Tweet, Reddit Meme Stocks Redux & AMC Beach Banner Drive Market Frenzy — You Should Play It Cool The most recent increase was largely driven by a new rewards program that includes a free large popcorn. The day after reaching this new high, AMC announced plans to sell 11.55 million shares and sent the stock tumbling. The shares sold for an average of $50.85 and closed at $55 yesterday. The prices might not seem that wild considering other stocks sell for hundreds of dollars, but to put it into perspective, AMC increased 400% in the past month alone. Yahoo! Finance reports that Macquarie analysts have reconfirmed their $6 price target and neutral rating on AMC in early afternoon trading last Thursday. While there is optimism for a post-pandemic rebound for box-office in general, analysts remained concerned about the company’s balance sheet overall. For reference, the cost of a movie ticket at an AMC theater is about $14, making the company’s stock value less than half the cost of one of its tickets to see a film. It is not difficult to justify a drastically lower valuation compared to current market price. AMC’s best-ever full net profit earnings was in 2016, with $111.7 million — long before the pressures of COVID-19 brought the industry to a full stop. Business Service News reports that operating cash flow stagnated as the company was forced to spend more and borrow more to grow its sales. AMC’s current market capitalization of about $25 billion is 225 times the company’s best-ever net profit. In a year when movie theaters virtually shut down full operations due to a global pandemic, this just doesn’t make sense.  See: Watch Out for These Stock Sell Offs

In the case of AMC, the hottest of them for now, traders may be trying to gauge where the company is headed. After raising $1.24 billion in equity in three installments in less than a month, each at a different price, it filed a preliminary proxy on Thursday seeking permission to sell 25 million more shares in 2022. It has been a roller-coaster for AMC traders who saw their stock double in just one session on Wednesday to hit a high of $83.63, only to fall in double digits on announcement of a new equity raise. The shares closed at $66.80 Friday. The pandemic has caused AMC's long-term debt levels to soar to $5.4 billion as of the first three months of this year from less than $2 billion in 2016. And it’s still losing money, with analysts expecting another $100 million to go over the next 12 months.

2021-06-03T12:37:14.000Z,Steely Meme-Stock Short Sellers Stare Down $4.5 Billion Loss,"(Bloomberg) -- The capacity of short-sellers to withstand pain is being tested anew by day traders driving up the share prices of meme stocks like AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. Paper losses from the bearish wagers on 10 of the most-shorted U.S. shares amounted to $4.5 billion Wednesday, according to Peter Hillerberg, co-founder of analytics provider Ortex. That includes $2.75 billion in unrealized losses for AMC following the stock’s 95% surge, rising to nearly $4 billion after adding in GameStop Corp. and Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. “How much longer can short sellers hold on?” Hillerberg wrote in an email. “The majority of short-sellers have been happy to sit on significant paper losses in the hope that retail investors will blink first and the losses won’t be realized. This now looks like a flawed strategy.” Professional speculators may still take issue with that last claim. While hedge funds were forced to retreat in late January under a similar withering assault whipped up on Reddit, this time around they are boosting their bearish wagers. Short positions against single shares climbed for a ninth straight week to reach an almost one-year high relative to overall equity holdings, according to prime-broker data compiled by Goldman Sachs Group Inc. The steadfastness of hedge funds is evident in AMC shares, where short interest remained elevated even after the stock more than doubled last week. The percentage of shares outstanding sold short edged higher Tuesday to top 20%. As the stock doubled again Wednesday, short interest only slipped below 19%, according to data from S3 Partners. Shares of AMC erased earlier gains in early trading Thursday after the movie-theater chain said it plans to sell up to 11.55 million of its common stock to repay debt and finance future acquisitions. The stock slipped about 8% as of 8:30 a.m. in New York. The dynamic contrasts with four months ago, when a rally in meme stocks like GameStop compelled hedge funds to quickly slash their short exposure to the lowest in five years. Goldman Sachs attributes the opposite reaction to the fact that the current carnage has yet to cause widespread pain for the industry.

2021-06-03T12:32:28.000Z,AMC Files to Sell More Stock After Sharp Rally,"(Bloomberg) -- AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. fluctuated in premarket trading after the company said it plans to sell up to 11.55 million shares of its common stock to repay debt and finance future acquisitions. Its shares briefly dipped after the announcement before resuming gains. AMC was last little changed, up less than 1% to $61 after climbing as much as 24% earlier. Thursday’s filing for the potential sale comes two days after AMC sold 8.5 million shares to Mudrick Capital for $230.5 million. Those shares were then flipped and sold for a profit as the New York-based investment firm told clients AMC’s stock was overvalued. The company is warning investors that they could lose their entire investment should they buy its shares. “The market prices and trading volume of our shares of Class A common stock have recently experienced, and may continue to experience, extreme volatility, which could cause purchasers of our Class A common stock to incur substantial losses,” AMC said in its filing. The filing allows for shares to be sold at-the-market, which is unlike a traditional stock offering because the buyers are found in the open market where retail traders thrive. Stocks sold in traditional offerings are purchased mostly by institutional investors. B. Riley will handle the transaction. A frenzied rally on AMC shares has pushed shares in the money-losing stock up nearly 3,000% this year and left it with a market capitalization of $31.3 billion, making it more valuable than half of the companies in the S&P 500 Index. Here’s what Bloomberg Intelligence says: “Issuance creates a dilution risk but can aid deleveraging,” analyst Geetha Ranganathan said in a note Thursday.

2021-06-07T20:23:41.000Z,AMC Shares Jump as New Meme-Stock Favorite Returns to FormBloomberg,"(Bloomberg) -- AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. rose for the first day in three amid a broader advance in meme stocks and as regulators warned they are monitoring the frenzied trading in the group of shares for any signs of market manipulation. The stock closed 15% higher at $55 on Monday. Its shares more than doubled on the first two days of a holiday-shortened last week, but gave back some of those gains after insiders cashed in with a flurry of share sales. In a statement Monday, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said it’s monitoring markets for manipulation and other forms of misconduct amid the frenzied surge in so-called meme stocks. “We will act to protect retail investors if violations of federal securities laws are found,” the agency said. Read more: SEC Says It’s Scrutinizing Market Swings as Meme Stocks Surge On the brink of bankruptcy only a few months ago, AMC is now the darling of retail traders, with this year’s near-2,500% gain ranking as the most of any stock in the Russell 3000 Index. That’s despite calls from across Wall Street that the shares aren’t worth anywhere near where they currently trade. “The stock continues to not reflect fundamentals,” said Macquarie analyst Chad Beynon. “Retail traders are focusing on price and not what that translates to in terms of valuations,” he added. Still, the surge has enabled the company to sell equity and shore up its shaky balance sheet. AMC is building a “strategic war chest,” B Riley analyst Eric Wold wrote in a note.“In addition to our continued expectation that AMC could improve its balance sheet and future cash flows through debt repurchases/pay-downs, we could now see either acquisitions of smaller exhibitor chains or the takeover of leases from troubled chains,” he said. Company insiders have also started to take advantage of AMC’s swift run up in share price. At least six people affiliated with the firm sold more than $8 million of stock last week, according to regulatory filings with the SEC. Carla Chavarria, the company’s head of human resources, unloaded $2.5 million worth of shares, while Gary Locke, who is up for re-election to the board, sold more than 34,000 shares for $1.7 million.

2021-06-03T12:15:27.000Z,AMC just dropped the hammer on every meme stock CEO,"The Meme Market is back with a vengeance.  And AMC (AMC) is playing a different game the second time around.  On Thursday morning, the company filed to sell up to an additional 11.5 million shares as its stock price continues a monster run higher.  On Wednesday alone AMC shares rose 95% and in pre-market trading on Thursday the stock was at one point up another 20%.  But this does not mark the company's first effort to capitalize on recent volatility.  Earlier this week AMC raised $230 million from Mudrick Capital in an offering the company said ""will allow us to be aggressive in going after the most valuable theatre assets, as well as to make other strategic investments in our business and to pursue deleveraging opportunities.""  On Wednesday, the company announced a new shareholder platform that will offer investors perks at actual movie theaters, including free popcorn. As we wrote in Thursday's Morning Brief, a company's stock is its currency and AMC is currently using a sharp rise in the value of this currency to improve its actual business.  And with all these moves, AMC CEO Adam Aron and the whole executive team at the company are putting the pressure on their peers running other companies caught up in the meme trade to not just let this market moment come and go. These are episodes that management teams must cash in on.  Back in the winter when GameStop (GME) was the focal point of the first meme stock rally that management team sat on its hands for months. And now GameStop is in the process of looking for a new CEO.  And while the rally in AMC and other meme names right now might not make sense, from the vantage point of a management team that tries to create value for shareholders the way to respond to this interest is clear: you sell stock until the market can't take it anymore.  AMC's filing on Thursday also does not obligate the company to sell additional shares now or at any time. It merely allows AMC to reserve the right to sell stock.

2021-06-07T18:17:49.000Z,Reddit’s WallStreetBets has a new favorite stockFortune,"GameStop and AMC are trading at levels no one could have imagined a year ago. Now, Reddit’s r/WallStreetBets community is looking for the next company whose stock is set to explode—and seems to have settled on Blackberry. The company behind the once iconic line of pagers and smartphones has seen its shares increase 137% year to date. That’s nothing compared to the 1,472% increase in GameStop and the 2,705% bump for AMC, but it’s the biggest surge the company has seen in two years. And, judging by chatter on r/WallStreetBets, interest is growing. A look at the subreddit Monday finds seven of the top 20 posts are dedicated solely to Blackberry. (Four others are focused on praising Clover Health Investments.) The stock is currently trading in the $15-$16 range, but the most enthusiastic investors are hoping to see it hit $50. “Don’t stop, BBelieving!!” encouraged user TehlorO. Meanwhile, user Substantial_Diver_34 showed a screenshot of what he says is his portfolio that is 100% committed to Blackberry, with over 6,400 shares. It was, at the time of the shot, down $14,000. The post is entitled “What have I done?” Other users gave nothing but encouragement. “I'll tell you what you've done: You've guaranteed your place amongst the millionares,” wrote kingandr3, while Firesice offered “You put in a winning bid...just needs a little time.” WSB bulls say Blackberry has grown from being a phone company to a cybersecurity firm that has deals with [hotlink]Amazon[/hotlink] and others and could be well positioned to take a position in the electric vehicle marketspace. Analysts aren’t as sure. Four firms currently have “Sell” ratings on the company, with only one suggesting investors buy. Of course, the r/WallStreetBets effect often defies the logic of analysts. AMC and [hotlink]GameStop[/hotlink] were floundering a year ago. Now, their stock prices and market caps have increased so much in recent months that they could join the Russell 1000 by the end of the month.

2021-06-07T14:31:20.000Z,SEC Says It’s Scrutinizing Market Swings as Meme Stocks SurgeBloomberg,"(Bloomberg) -- The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said it’s scrutinizing markets for signs of manipulation and other misconduct as AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. and other meme stocks continue to surge. “SEC staff continues to monitor the market in light of the ongoing volatility in certain stocks to determine if there have been any disruptions of the market, manipulative trading or other misconduct,” the agency said in a Monday emailed statement. “In addition, we will act to protect retail investors if violations of federal securities laws are found.” AMC resumed its upward trajectory Monday, halting two straight days of declines. The stock -- like GameStop Corp. before it -- has become a darling of retail traders. The movie-theater chain’s wild rise comes despite questionable fundamentals, prompting concerns among regulators that investors could be sitting on substantial losses if the stock plunges. The SEC has already said it’s investigating what happened with GameStop in January, with a focus on whether traders were using online message boards to dupe other investors into buying into the rally.

2021-06-07T13:33:13.000Z,Surging meme stocks like AMC and GameStop send Russell 2000 skyrocketingYahoo Finance,"Meme stock mania has been mighty kind to the small-cap Russell 2000 Index after its reconstitution last June.  The total market capitalization of the Russell 2000 Index surged 84% from last year’s reconstitution (or the addition and subtraction of new companies to the index) to $3.5 trillion, FTSE Russell said in weekend tweet. This year alone, the Russell 2000 is up more than 16% compared to a 12% gain for the S&P 500. ""In 2020, overall capitalization for the U.S. equity market stayed fairly flat, decreasing by 1%. However, we’ve seen a surge in growth in the first half of 2021 with the total market cap in the Russell 1000 reaching $44.1 trillion. We have also seen a resurgence in market capitalizations of small cap companies in the Russell 2000 reflecting the overall bounce back of U.S. equity markets following the COVID-19 recession in early 2020,"" said FTSE Russell CEO Arne Staal. To be sure, the index has been powered by massive gains in popular stocks among a new army of retail trades such as AMC (AMC) and GameStop (GME).  AMC shares have gained more than 700% in one-year's time, giving the money-losing movie theater chain a whopping $25 billion market cap. As for struggling GameStop, its stock has exploded 4,900% over the past year — it now sports a lofty $17.6 billion market cap. Given each company's bulging market caps, they are likely to be removed from the Russell 1000. The index typically showcases companies with sub $5 billion market caps.  Currently, the smallest company in the Russell 2000 Index is Velocity Financial (VEL). It boasts a market cap of $257.1 million, an increase of 171.2% from $94.8 million in 2020.  FTSE Russell's changes to its various indexes will take place after U.S. stock markets close on June 25. The company points out the reconstitution will impact more than $10.6 trillion in investor assets benchmarked to, or invested in, products based on the Russell U.S. indexes.

2021-06-03T12:02:12.000Z,AMC Entertainment (AMC) Moves 95.2% Higher: Will This Strength Last?,"AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. AMC shares ended the last trading session 95.2% higher at $62.55. The jump came on an impressive volume with a higher-than-average number of shares changing hands in the session. This compares to the stock's 241.2% gain over the past four weeks. Shares of AMC Entertainment jumped after the company announced a program called AMC Investor Connect that will reward small-time investors with goodies such as special screenings, free tickets and free popcorn. Also, it has recently announced that it has raised more than $230 million capital by way of selling 8.5 million shares. Price and Consensus This movie theater operator is expected to post quarterly loss of $0.94 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +82.7%. Revenues are expected to be $362.27 million, up 1816.8% from the year-ago quarter. While earnings and revenue growth expectations are important in evaluating the potential strength in a stock, empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements. For AMC Entertainment, the consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 6.8% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. And a negative trend in earnings estimate revisions doesn't usually translate into price appreciation. So, make sure to keep an eye on AMC going forward to see if this recent jump can turn into more strength down the road. The stock currently carries a Zacks Rank 3 (Hold).

2021-06-07T09:30:56.000Z,How AMC is differentAxios,"AMC has learned its lesson from the meme winter, and is determined to use the meme summer to its advantage. That's the lesson from last week's wild action in AMC stock, much of which was orchestrated by the company itself. Why it matters: There's a case to be made that AMC only managed to avoid bankruptcy by getting caught up in the meme-stock craze of January, when its share price first became divorced from fundamentals. Get market news worthy of your time with Axios Markets. Subscribe for free. The company might not be able to make money by selling movie tickets, but it's proving itself a master of bringing in money by selling share certificates. How it works: AMC has steadily issued new stock, most recently on Thursday, when it sold more than 11 million shares in less than three hours, netting $587.4 million — more than the entire company's equity value at the beginning of the year. By the numbers: The total number of AMC Class A shares outstanding has risen tenfold from 50 million this time last year, to 500 million today. As a result, the company's market capitalization has risen even faster than its stratospheric share price. The big picture: When GameStop first started heading to the moon, the overwhelming consensus was that the stock had become a pure gambling vehicle that was inevitably going to crash, creating massive losses for people who bought into the hype. Those losses didn't happen: GameStop stock continues to trade at extremely elevated levels, raising the prospect that meme stocks can actually be (very risky) investments, rather than just short-term trades. Once meme stocks become a potential investment, companies can take advantage of that fact by issuing new shares on the capital market — just as other risky companies like Tesla have done in the past. The difference between Tesla and AMC is that AMC isn't a technology stock with the potential to dominate the world. It's just a chain of movie theaters, struggling in the face of a long-term secular decline in Americans' desire to see any but the very biggest movies outside the home.

2021-06-07T14:20:37.000Z,"AMC, other 'meme' stocks jump; regulator signals concernReuters","By Aaron Saldanha, Sinéad Carew and David Randall (Reuters) -Shares of AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc and other ""meme stocks"" jumped on Monday, extending a rally in social-media favorites into a third week as message boards hummed with talk of squeezing Wall Street short-sellers. The sharp gains prompted the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to say it was looking into signs of market manipulation given the ""volatility in certain stocks."" The volatility has challenged analysts, and two of them in the past week have stopped covering video game retailer GameStop, whose shares soared in January in a retail-driven rally. Cinema operator AMC jumped almost 15%, putting its gain over the past five sessions at 111%. BlackBerry's U.S. listing surged 14% and is now up 57% since the start of June. ""AMC never ceases to amaze me. Just when I think that train is over, it jumps almost 10 points in the first 30 min of trading,"" one poster on Reddit wrote. AMC shares are up about 2,500% in 2021 as the company has courted individual investors, while GameStop has surged over 1,300% year to date. Some bearish investors retreated from bets against AMC on Friday. Short interest slumped to 74.5 million shares, or 14.9% of AMC's float, from 88.2 million on Thursday, according to S3 Partners. Clover Health Investments, which has been the target of short sellers, was one of the most mentioned stocks on Reddit's wallstreetbets on Monday, with some users suggesting the shares as the forum's next short-squeeze target. The insurer's shares soared 32% in their highest volume trading day since April 19. Institutional investors are largely sitting on the sidelines as the meme-stock rally continues. Amateur investors, however, ""don't need a reason,"" said Michael O'Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading in Stamford, Connecticut. ""They're trying to do the same thing they did last week. It's a new week. They start over, the meme stock buyers, the wallstreetbets Reddit community.""              ",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amc-jumps-19-funds-eye-142037991.html

2021-06-03T10:15:17.000Z,‘Don’t Be That Sucker:’ Traders Warn Against Joining AMC Rally,"(Bloomberg) -- The staggering surge in AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. as a result of Reddit fans’ frenzy is making professional market participants increasingly uneasy. After retail traders sent the shares of the unprofitable movie-theater chain to a record high, bringing this year’s advance to almost 3,000%, investors and strategists are warning that the chances of getting badly burned and losing money on this trade are now very high. “The Reddit bandwagon will find new targets and revenge against short sellers is highly likely to continue,” Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said by email. “This has turned into a game, so investors who don’t have money they can afford to lose should stay clear of hot stocks. If lots of people are piling into a company, they are probably buying it at an inflated price, and as we’ve seen, rapid spikes in prices are often followed by equally rapid falls.” On Thursday, the Reddit-fueled rally showed no signs it’s running out of steam. AMC gained 18% in premarket trading to $73.80 as of 6:11 a.m. in New York. Here’s what market players are saying about the risks and outlook for AMC’s shares: Joachim Klement, a strategist at Liberum: “By now many studies have been done on the GameStop frenzy in January and they all point to the fact that retail traders can distort prices for a short while, but they on average don’t make money with it and in fact lose money doing that.”“Institutional investors should ignore these meme stocks and wait until the share price has settled down. Like in every bubble, the retail investors will eventually run out of people who are willing to buy into the hype, at which point the bubble bursts and the last ones holding the bag will have to nurse their losses.”“AMC and other meme stocks are a case of people trying to find a sucker to buy into the hype who will take your overvalued stocks from you. Don’t be that sucker.” James Athey, investment director at Aberdeen Asset Management:                ",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/don-t-sucker-traders-warn-101517505.html
2021-06-07T13:39:06.000Z,Investors buying meme stocks need to be ready for downside risks: strategistYahoo Finance Video,"JJ Kinahan, TD Ameritrade Chief Market Strategist, joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss why more investors are buying meme stocks this year and the potential risks of buying GameStop and AMC Entertainment. MYLES UDLAND: OK, joining us now to talk about the state of the markets and how retail has been playing this market is JJ Kinahan. He's the Chief Market Strategist over at TD Ameritrade. So JJ, right before you came on, you heard us talking about what's happening with the meme names. You guys have your latest survey out of what your investors have moved in and out of the most. And a name that I did not see on that list was AMC. What have you seen on your side in some of these big names that really constitute kind of the core of the meme trade? JJ KINAHAN: Sure. So you know, if you think about it, AMC, GameStop, et cetera, for the last month wasn't necessarily as big a story. It became a bigger story right at the end of the month. What was interesting to me is when I looked at those stocks is that the week before Memorial-- so Memorial Day was a week ago today, it was last week on Tuesday that we really saw these explode. The week before, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday is when we actually saw our clients start to buy those names more. On Tuesday and Wednesday, our clients were more even in terms of their buying and selling of the stocks. So I thought that that part was really, really interesting overall. Obviously, the interest increased pretty significantly. Actually the one name that you didn't talk about but I know is part of the picture-- and just, you guys, it was a great discussion, had a lot to cover there-- was BlackBerry. BlackBerry was a name that in terms of percentage-wise, the volume picked up very significantly. Because GameStop and AMC continue to have this sort of interest all the time. And I thought it was interesting, you know, Julia was comparing some of this when we go down and people come in and buy it, to Tesla. And you know, and the stocks our clients purchased last month, Tesla was one of them, because they did sell off. And I think there was a little bit of a difference-- and it's one of the things you guys were talking about-- and that I also believe in talking to our clients that there's a belief that AMC is also a reopening play as much as a meme stock play, because people think that there is a hunger for movies and good movies, and people like the theater experience.

Subscribe Thursday, June 3, 2021 When the market moves at the speed of AMC (AMC) it can be hard to keep up.  But all we can tell readers for sure is that the Meme Market is back.  On Wednesday alone, AMC shares nearly doubled, rising 95% to close at a record $62.55. AMC's market cap is now just north of $28 billion. Since the beginning of May, AMC stock is up more than 500%. Year-to-date, shares have gained about 3,000%.  The superlatives can go on. AMC was not alone, however. Shares of Bed, Bath & Beyond (BBBY), Express (EXPR), and BlackBerry (BB) all rose more than 30% on Wednesday. Even our old friends at GameStop (GME) got involved, rising some 13% amid a broad rally in meme names widely discussed on reddit and elsewhere.  But after the GameStop saga of mid-winter came and went, the market's energy moved into areas like NFTs and cryptocurrencies. Dogecoin (DOGE-USD) became a better indicator of risk sentiment than the VIX. In the background of all this the major U.S. stock indexes were treading water, minding their own business as the economy continued to rebound from last year's recession.  Along the way, the Morning Brief highlighted survey data from Deutsche Bank published in late February that suggested retail traders had no plans to leave the market. In April, fund flow data from Bank of America showed retail investors were still buying stocks while institutions were lightening up on their equity exposure.   A redux of this winter's full-on meme market, however, seemed unlikely.  And yet here we are.  The differences between the winter's GameStop episode and the present mania, of course, are many.  There has not yet been the emergence of a broad ""Wall Street vs. Main Street"" dynamic quite yet. Self-promotors from the world of tech, and crypto, and sports betting haven't inserted themselves into the present conversation with the same enthusiasm as was seen back in February.

For instance, there are a lot of tax proposals on the table right now, Todd. TODD BOEHLY: Yeah, no, I think I try to not get too wound up about things I can't control. And I think we're on a roller coaster, and taxes go up, and taxes go down, and taxes go up. And if you look at the history of the US, I think taxes during the Civil War were, you know, 90%. So I just think you're on a ride. And, you know, as a human, I don't get too worked up about it. Because I'm more focused on, you know, what I can control. And, you know, I'm not going to get bent around an axle on something I can't control. A, I think it's worthless. And B, it makes me frustrated, so why would I want to do that to myself? But ultimately, I think that, you know, they're doing a good job of kind of managing a complex puzzle, right. And the reality is, you know, I know like how many things can go wrong in my own businesses every day with thousands of people. And then you think about like, you know, managing a country, I don't think it's a small feat. So I think you're doing-- I think that they're doing a good job. And you know, again, I'm just happy to be an American. So, you know, I think there's-- no matter what, when you start to look at the opportunity set we get and all the benefits that are ascribed, and there's no guarantees that you were born an American. And a lot of us end up holding cards that, you know, we were born with, right. So you kind of have to start with that mentality, at least from my point of view, and then figure out how you can continue to make things better, how you keep evolving, right. And I think we're in such an exciting time, you know, with evolution kind of changing so dramatically, so quickly, and across so many different things. So, you know, I think we're lucky to be alive and we're lucky to be American.     ",https://finance.yahoo.com/video/billionaire-biden-tax-proposals-try-100000129.html

[MUSIC PLAYING] RACHEL FOX: Hey, option traders. For today's Option Review, we're going to take a look at what's going on in AMC and a few other stocks, as the Reddit Wallstreetbets crowd is clearly targeted a handful of companies yesterday once again. AMC's stock jumped 95% yesterday. And luckily for call option buyers, they were able to cash in on the massive move throughout the day. AMC, along with other stocks, such as BlackBerry and Bed, Bath, and Beyond, saw massive call option volume as retail traders continued to squeeze institutional investors out of their short trades. AMC, BlackBerry, and Bed, Bath, and Beyond options were the most actively traded of any stock or ETF on the day. So let's take a look at these stocks together to see which specific option contract was the most highly targeted. So we're on my ThinkorSwim dashboard. And first, we're going to look at AMC's stock. So I have the ticker typed in up here. We're going to look at options contracts that expire the week of June 4, which June 4 is tomorrow. So they expire tomorrow. The highest volume contract was the 73 straight calls, which traded over 233,000 contracts. And the calls were up 2,462% on the day. And for BlackBerry, ticker symbol BB, it was the June 4 15-strike call, which is right here. And that one had traded 136,000 contracts. And that's what had the most volume. But there was also the June 18 43-strike call, which is all the way down here. And that saw the biggest percentage gain at 1,450%. Clearly, out-of-the-money calls are a favorite for Wallstreetbets traders. And finally, let's take a look at Bed, Bath, & Beyond saw 35,000 contracts traded in the June 4 calls at the 45 strike. And those calls were up an astounding 11,080% on the day.    ",https://finance.yahoo.com/video/option-trade-review-amc-stock-093249259.html
2021-06-07T19:37:29.000Z,Meme Stock Bulls Take Back Control as Hedge Fund Battle RagesFX Empire,"After a wave of selling heading into the weekend, retail investors have wrestled back control of their favorite shorted stocks, including AMC Entertainment and GameStop. The stocks are off their highs of the day, and retail investors are convinced that something shady is going on. Short sellers are swinging back after losing USD 2.2 billion from AMC’s rally last week. There are theories of traders pulling out all the stops — including the illegal practice of naked shorting, which is currently trending on Twitter. Shares of AMC have galloped 16% today but still failed to cross the psychologically important USD 60 level, where the movie chain stock closed above on June 2 for the first time. While AMC might be off its peak, investors don’t have much to clamor about considering that the stock has skyrocketed more than 467% since early May. Fellow WallStreetBets stock GameStop is tacking on close to 11% in today’s session. The stock has gained more than 1,400% year-to-date for a market cap of USD 19.4 billion. GameStop investors have proven to be a loyal bunch as it hasn’t always been easy to hold. But those who have stuck around continue to be rewarded with more potential runway for gains. Ihor Dusaniwsky, managing director of predictive analytics at S3 Partners, revealed in a tweet that GMC and AMC each have a short squeeze risk score attached of 10 out of a possible 10. Meanwhile, the WallStreetBets crowd has taken over Twitter, with #nakedshorting trending on the social media site. To be clear, unlike regular shorting, which is legal, naked selling is not legal. It has to do with selling shares that have not been issued yet. Nonetheless, it still happens in the market. Naked shorting is how 140% of GameStop’s float can have short interest, as pointed out by Charles Payne on Fox Business. Christian, Smith & Jewell Law Firm Attorney Wes Christian said he blames the prime brokers that are custodying the assets as well as market makers for this behavior.

2021-06-03T08:21:05.000Z,"AMC stock on rollercoaster, movie chain completes another share sale","By Aaron Saldanha (Reuters) -Shares of retail favorite AMC Entertainment went on a rollercoaster ride on Thursday before ending lower after the company said it completed another share offering, raising $587.4 million in additional equity capital. AMC has been taking advantage of a blistering run in its stock price to complete two share issues in three days. In announcing the latest issue, it said it did not know how long the run would last and warned investors of the risks involved. ""These prices are not going to last forever, so why not use this opportunity to shore up your balance sheet and raise some cash,"" said Dennis Dick, a trader at Bright Trading LLC in Las Vegas. Shares of the movie theater chain, which counts more than 80% of its shareholder base as retail, or 3.2 million individual investors, were down 18% at $51.34 at the close. The share price nearly doubled on Wednesday to a record close of $62.55 thanks partly to a wave of retail investor buying. The wild ride is reminiscent of the huge gains that GameStop made earlier in the year when traders bought up the video game retailer, betting against hedge funds that had bearish positions. ""Our current market prices reflect market and trading dynamics unrelated to our underlying business, or macro or industry fundamentals, and we do not know how long these dynamics will last,"" AMC said in a statement on Thursday. The company said it completed an 11.55 million share offering it announced before the market opened at an average price of approximately $50.85 per share. A number of Wall Street analysts have said AMC is already overvalued and many institutional investors have said they are steering clear of the stock, which is popular with traders who congregate on Reddit's WallStreetBets and other forums. Wednesday's record price was 30 times the level AMC traded at the end of 2020 and came a day after it issued 8.5 million shares to Mudrick Capital, which the hedge fund flipped at a profit..

AMC shares are up 3000% so far this year, but this hasn’t changed the economic reality surrounding the company. The pandemic has caused its long-term debt levels to soar to $5.4 billion as of the first three months of this year from less than $2 billion in 2016. And it’s still losing money, with analysts expecting another $100 million to go over the next 12 months.

2021-06-03T08:11:55.000Z,AMC Extends Surge as Reddit’s Retail Frenzy Reaches New Heights,"(Bloomberg) -- AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. extended Wednesday’s surge in premarket trading as the Reddit retail-trading army continued to gorge on the stock, sending it to heights that has left Wall Street pros perplexed. After rising 95% to a record high in the last regular session, AMC gained 13% to $71.01 as of 4:02 a.m. in New York. The money-losing movie-theater chain has a market value of more than $30 billion, making it more valuable than at least half of the companies in the S&P 500 Index. While most financial commentators agree that the stock has detached itself from traditional investment fundamentals, they are less sure of the reason. Some cite an abundance of liquidity and savings created during the pandemic, while others point to the impact of social media in providing a platform for small investors to egg each other on. “Of course their valuation is disconnected from fundamentals, the prices are more a reflection of the impact of social media,” said Sylvain Goyon, a strategist at Oddo. “The shares rise with the hype and die without it.” The latest meme stock frenzy appears to have even greater momentum behind it than that of GameStop Corp. back in January. Some Twitter users reported receiving text messages from family members urging them to buy AMC stock as a way to get rich, while other people gathered at street corners with homemade posters saying “AMC 2 Da Moon” and promoted the stock at pool parties. As of Wednesday’s close, AMC stock had risen almost 30-fold since the start of this year, far exceeding GameStop’s 15-fold increase. Going back to the beginning of 2020, the shares recently surpassed the performance of Zoom Video Communications Inc., whose video-conferencing technology became ubiquitous during the pandemic. Just a few short months ago, AMC was on the brink of bankruptcy as the pandemic shuttered cinemas across the U.S. Its market capitalization stood at just $216.8 million in April of last year. Even after the brief surge in January, many professional investors still pooh-poohed the idea that anyone on Reddit’s WallStreetBets forum could be taken seriously, much less move the market in a sustainable way.

MYLES UDLAND: OK, joining us now to talk about the state of the markets and how retail has been playing this market is JJ Kinahan. He's the Chief Market Strategist over at TD Ameritrade. So JJ, right before you came on, you heard us talking about what's happening with the meme names. You guys have your latest survey out of what your investors have moved in and out of the most. And a name that I did not see on that list was AMC. What have you seen on your side in some of these big names that really constitute kind of the core of the meme trade? JJ KINAHAN: Sure. So you know, if you think about it, AMC, GameStop, et cetera, for the last month wasn't necessarily as big a story. It became a bigger story right at the end of the month. What was interesting to me is when I looked at those stocks is that the week before Memorial-- so Memorial Day was a week ago today, it was last week on Tuesday that we really saw these explode. The week before, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday is when we actually saw our clients start to buy those names more. On Tuesday and Wednesday, our clients were more even in terms of their buying and selling of the stocks. So I thought that that part was really, really interesting overall. Obviously, the interest increased pretty significantly. Actually the one name that you didn't talk about but I know is part of the picture-- and just, you guys, it was a great discussion, had a lot to cover there-- was BlackBerry. BlackBerry was a name that in terms of percentage-wise, the volume picked up very significantly. Because GameStop and AMC continue to have this sort of interest all the time. And I thought it was interesting, you know, Julia was comparing some of this when we go down and people come in and buy it, to Tesla. And you know, and the stocks our clients purchased last month, Tesla was one of them, because they did sell off. And I think there was a little bit of a difference-- and it's one of the things you guys were talking about-- and that I also believe in talking to our clients that there's a belief that AMC is also a reopening play as much as a meme stock play, because people think that there is a hunger for movies and good movies, and people like the theater experience.

2021-06-07T20:23:41.000Z,AMC Shares Jump as New Meme-Stock Favorite Returns to FormBloomberg,"(Bloomberg) -- AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. rose for the first day in three amid a broader advance in meme stocks and as regulators warned they are monitoring the frenzied trading in the group of shares for any signs of market manipulation. The stock closed 15% higher at $55 on Monday. Its shares more than doubled on the first two days of a holiday-shortened last week, but gave back some of those gains after insiders cashed in with a flurry of share sales. In a statement Monday, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said it’s monitoring markets for manipulation and other forms of misconduct amid the frenzied surge in so-called meme stocks. “We will act to protect retail investors if violations of federal securities laws are found,” the agency said. Read more: SEC Says It’s Scrutinizing Market Swings as Meme Stocks Surge On the brink of bankruptcy only a few months ago, AMC is now the darling of retail traders, with this year’s near-2,500% gain ranking as the most of any stock in the Russell 3000 Index. That’s despite calls from across Wall Street that the shares aren’t worth anywhere near where they currently trade. “The stock continues to not reflect fundamentals,” said Macquarie analyst Chad Beynon. “Retail traders are focusing on price and not what that translates to in terms of valuations,” he added. Still, the surge has enabled the company to sell equity and shore up its shaky balance sheet. AMC is building a “strategic war chest,” B Riley analyst Eric Wold wrote in a note.“In addition to our continued expectation that AMC could improve its balance sheet and future cash flows through debt repurchases/pay-downs, we could now see either acquisitions of smaller exhibitor chains or the takeover of leases from troubled chains,” he said. Company insiders have also started to take advantage of AMC’s swift run up in share price. At least six people affiliated with the firm sold more than $8 million of stock last week, according to regulatory filings with the SEC. Carla Chavarria, the company’s head of human resources, unloaded $2.5 million worth of shares, while Gary Locke, who is up for re-election to the board, sold more than 34,000 shares for $1.7 million.

Welcome to the world of AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc Chief Executive Adam Aron, who since the beginning of the year has taken to new heights the role of chief promoter of a company that was on the brink of bankruptcy.  At a time when many on Wall Street argue that the movie theater operator is over-valued and in dire need of an accelerated economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic to justify its share price, Aron, 66, is leaning in to the growing power of individual investors to keep so-called meme stocks surging.  “Watch out naysayers, AMC is going to play on offense again. Here we come!” Aron wrote in a June 1 tweet https://twitter.com/CEOAdam/status/1399683077660721152.  He has been riding a wave of enthusiasm for the stock. AMC shares are up nearly 3,000% since the start of the year and almost doubled on Wednesday to close at $62.55 a share, way above the average target price of $5.11 among Wall Street analysts, according to Refinitiv data. AMC is now valued at $28.2 billion, based on Wednesday’s closing price. Aron, who became CEO in 2016 after running the National Basketball Association’s Philadelphia 76ers, started promoting AMC after its shares were swept up in a retail buying frenzy in January.  AMC did not respond to a request for comment, and Aron did not reply to a direct message on Twitter.  Aron is part of a growing number of executives on Wall Street such as Tesla Inc’s Elon Musk and the incoming chairman of GameStop Corp, Ryan Cohen, who appear to be doing more to court retail rather than institutional investors.   “These individual investors likely own a majority of our shares,” Aron said during the company’s May earnings call. “They own AMC.

At 7:05 AM ET (1205 GMT), the Dow futures contract was down 215 points, or 0.6%, S&P 500 futures traded 30 points, or 0.7%, lower, and Nasdaq 100 futures dropped 120 points, or 0.9%. The major indices all closed marginally higher Wednesday, near record highs, but worries that a stronger-than-expected economic rebound will result in higher inflation and thus sooner-than-expected monetary policy tightening have deprived the asset class of a lot of its momentum. Investors will focus on Thursday’s packed data slate for fresh clues on the pace of recovery in the world's largest economy, and thus Federal Reserve thinking,. First off the blocks is the ADP jobs number, at 8:15 AM ET, which is expected to say the economy added 650,000 private sector jobs in May, a slight slowdown from the 742,000 which were added in April.  The weekly initial jobless claims data follows 15 minutes later, with expectations calling for a number of 390,000 claims for the week ending May 28, an improvement from the 406,000 the previous week and a new post-pandemic low. Also due for release is the May ISM non-manufacturing PMI, at 10 AM ET, which is expected to show renewed confidence in the vital services sector, especially after the equivalent numbers in Europe impressed earlier in the day. In the corporate sector, AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) will remain in focus, with the meme stock favorite rallying 20% in the premarket, a day after shares doubled in a single session. Other Reddit favorites, like BlackBerry (NYSE:BB) and Bed Bath&Beyond (NASDAQ:BBBY), are also set to push higher as retail inventors act together to bid up shares of heavily-shorted companies, forcing short sellers to unwind their bets at a loss. The earnings calendar Thursday includes the likes of online office tool DocuSign (NASDAQ:DOCU), group messaging app Slack Technologies (NYSE:WORK), leisure wear retailer Lululemon Athletica (NASDAQ:LULU) and chipmaker Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO).

2021-06-07T11:15:37.000Z,S&P closes nominally lower as investors wait for a catalystReuters,"By Stephen Culp NEW YORK (Reuters) - The S&P 500 ended a languid session slightly in the red on Monday, with investors standing by on news of a global minimum corporate tax rate, lingering inflation fears, and a lack of market-moving economic news. The Dow closed well within negative territory, while the Nasdaq advanced. Still, the S&P and the Dow remained inside one percentage point of their record closing highs. ""Thematically, we're done with earnings, so you have this lull in between earnings when what drives the market is economic data points,"" said Joseph Sroka, chief investment officer at NovaPoint in Atlanta. ""There's not a lot of impetus for investors to take action today."" ""There's been this flip-flop between whether inflation will be transitory or persistent, and the next card that gets flipped over for that is the CPI report on Thursday,"" Sroka added. Smallcaps outperformed as the ongoing retail frenzy boosted stocks whose recent explosive trading volumes have been attributed to social media buzz. AMC Entertainment Holdings jumped 14.8%, extending the previous week's 85% gain. Other so-called ""meme stocks,"" including GameStop Corp and U.S.-listed shares of Blackberry Ltd advanced between 7% and 14%. ""You've seen a decades-long, technology-enabled democratization of the market and there's certainly groups of individual investors that flock to these ideas,"" Sroka said. ""We're seeing speculative trading in an age of multiple outlets and social media amplifies the news."" The Group of Seven (G7) advanced economies agreed on Saturday to back a minimum global corporate tax rate of at least 15%, a move Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen called a ""significant, unprecedented commitment"" to bring what she called a race to the bottom on global taxation. Lawmakers in Washington are doubling down on efforts to craft a bipartisan infrastructure spending package, with House Democrats expected to bring a bill to vote as early as Wednesday.

2021-06-03T05:37:49.000Z,"AMC Set For New Records, Up 20% Premarket, Blackberry Gains 30%","By Dhirendra Tripathi Investing — Meme stock favorite AMC (NYSE:AMC) looked set for another blockbuster run Thursday, rallying 20% in the premarket, a day after shares more than doubled in a single session. BlackBerry (NYSE:BB) was up too, rising 30% in premarket, while GameStop (NYSE:GME), the original meme stock darling, gained 3%, in line with its relatively subdued trend in recent times. The meme stock rally has been driven by by retail inventors acting together to bid up shares of heavily shorted companies, forcing short sellers to unwind their bets at a loss. AMC has done much more recently beyond offering free popcorn to investors who sign who sign up for its AMC Investor Connect, an initiative to engage directly with its sizable retail shareholders, to attract attention but this demolition of trading records and stock market highs has left many baffled. In less than a month, AMC has raised $658.5 million in equity. Part of this money will be spent on new leases and revamping old theatres. But the pandemic has caused its long-term debt levels to soar to $5.4 billion as of the first three months of this year from less than $2 billion in 2016. And it’s still losing money, with analysts expecting another $100 million to go over the next 12 months. Many experts have warned that retail traders, who are looking for quick money, could end up hurting themselves as the fundamentals of the companies aren’t strong enough to justify current valuations.

2021-06-03T05:16:17.000Z,"AMC Rally, Jobless Claims and David Beckham - What's Moving Markets","By Peter Nurse Investing.com — AMC Entertainment continues to post staggering stock gains. However, crude oil and Wall Street have paused recent positive runs ahead of a data deluge, headed by U.S. jobless claims numbers. Meanwhile, the electric car market has received a celebrity backer. Here's what's moving markets on Thursday, June 3rd. 1. Onward and upward for AMC Entertainment There appears to be no stopping AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC).The stock of the movie-theatre chain, the new darling of the Reddit community, is pointing firmly higher again premarket Thursday, after doubling in value during Wednesday’s session and surging more than 400% in the last two weeks alone. Its market capitalization has soared to $33 billion during this period, surpassing other so-called meme stocks - not bad for a company that was on the brink of bankruptcy at the start of the year. However, handing out treats like popcorn and special screenings hasn’t changed the economic reality surrounding the company.  The pandemic has caused its long-term debt levels to soar to $5.4 billion as of the first three months of this year from less than $2 billion in 2016. And it’s still losing money, with analysts expecting another $100 million to go over the next 12 months. Sure customers may well come back as the U.S. fully reopens, and its new AMC Investor Connect initiative may help on the margin, but there’s good reason to think the pandemic has permanently changed viewing habits. The media giants spending vast sums on buying streaming services certainly think so. AMC’s stunning climb has certainly rewarded investors who bought in early, but how long can this last? 2. Stocks to edge lower U.S. stocks are set to open marginally lower Thursday, continuing the muted start to the new month, ahead of a deluge of important economic data. By 6:30 AM ET, Dow Jones futures were down 60 points, or 0.2%, at just over 34,500, S&P 500 futures were 0.2% lower and Nasdaq 100 futures dropped 0.2%.

2021-06-08T20:04:23.000Z,"Stock market news live updates: S&P 500 ends near the flat line; meme stock resurgence fuels rally in Clover Health, Wendy’sYahoo Finance","Stocks were little changed Tuesday as traders considered a batch of new economic data, much of which pointed to ongoing labor shortages in the U.S. economy during the recovery.  The S&P 500 ended near the flat line to come within striking distance of its all-time high. The Dow fluctuated ended slightly lower, while the Nasdaq edged higher. More signs of labor shortages emerged, with employers scrambling to find qualified workers to fill positions and meet surging demand during the post-pandemic recovery. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that job openings soared to a record more than 9 million in April. And a separate new sentiment survey showed a record 48% of small businesses reported that they had unfilled job openings last month.  Investors this week have also been digesting more signals from officials over the path forward for monetary and fiscal policies as the economy rebounds from the pandemic, and what these might suggest for interest rates and corporate earnings. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said over the weekend that higher interest rates ""would actually be a plus for society's point of view and the Fed's point of view,"" according to an interview with Bloomberg.  Traders, however, have been less convinced. Higher interest rates could weigh on stock valuations, and additional corporate tax reforms could additionally cut into profits for major companies. Amazon (AMZN) shares fell on Monday following a report that Group of Seven finance ministers were looking to include the e-commerce giant in new global tax proposal. And investors continue to eye negotiations between President Joe Biden and members of Congress for his multi-trillion-dollar infrastructure proposal, which would likely be funded in part by increased corporate taxes and may come in the form of a raised corporate tax floor. Still, some strategists suggested investors' concerns around the headline issues of inflation and tax reform may be overblown. A solid economic growth backdrop may help outweigh some of these rate or policy headwinds.

2021-06-07T13:33:13.000Z,Surging meme stocks like AMC and GameStop send Russell 2000 skyrocketingYahoo Finance,"Meme stock mania has been mighty kind to the small-cap Russell 2000 Index after its reconstitution last June.  The total market capitalization of the Russell 2000 Index surged 84% from last year’s reconstitution (or the addition and subtraction of new companies to the index) to $3.5 trillion, FTSE Russell said in weekend tweet. This year alone, the Russell 2000 is up more than 16% compared to a 12% gain for the S&P 500. ""In 2020, overall capitalization for the U.S. equity market stayed fairly flat, decreasing by 1%. However, we’ve seen a surge in growth in the first half of 2021 with the total market cap in the Russell 1000 reaching $44.1 trillion. We have also seen a resurgence in market capitalizations of small cap companies in the Russell 2000 reflecting the overall bounce back of U.S. equity markets following the COVID-19 recession in early 2020,"" said FTSE Russell CEO Arne Staal. To be sure, the index has been powered by massive gains in popular stocks among a new army of retail trades such as AMC (AMC) and GameStop (GME).  AMC shares have gained more than 700% in one-year's time, giving the money-losing movie theater chain a whopping $25 billion market cap. As for struggling GameStop, its stock has exploded 4,900% over the past year — it now sports a lofty $17.6 billion market cap. Given each company's bulging market caps, they are likely to be removed from the Russell 1000. The index typically showcases companies with sub $5 billion market caps.  Currently, the smallest company in the Russell 2000 Index is Velocity Financial (VEL). It boasts a market cap of $257.1 million, an increase of 171.2% from $94.8 million in 2020.  FTSE Russell's changes to its various indexes will take place after U.S. stock markets close on June 25. The company points out the reconstitution will impact more than $10.6 trillion in investor assets benchmarked to, or invested in, products based on the Russell U.S. indexes.

2021-06-07T14:20:37.000Z,"AMC, other 'meme' stocks jump; regulator signals concernReuters","By Aaron Saldanha, Sinéad Carew and David Randall (Reuters) -Shares of AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc and other ""meme stocks"" jumped on Monday, extending a rally in social-media favorites into a third week as message boards hummed with talk of squeezing Wall Street short-sellers. The sharp gains prompted the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to say it was looking into signs of market manipulation given the ""volatility in certain stocks."" The volatility has challenged analysts, and two of them in the past week have stopped covering video game retailer GameStop, whose shares soared in January in a retail-driven rally. Cinema operator AMC jumped almost 15%, putting its gain over the past five sessions at 111%. BlackBerry's U.S. listing surged 14% and is now up 57% since the start of June. ""AMC never ceases to amaze me. Just when I think that train is over, it jumps almost 10 points in the first 30 min of trading,"" one poster on Reddit wrote. AMC shares are up about 2,500% in 2021 as the company has courted individual investors, while GameStop has surged over 1,300% year to date. Some bearish investors retreated from bets against AMC on Friday. Short interest slumped to 74.5 million shares, or 14.9% of AMC's float, from 88.2 million on Thursday, according to S3 Partners. Clover Health Investments, which has been the target of short sellers, was one of the most mentioned stocks on Reddit's wallstreetbets on Monday, with some users suggesting the shares as the forum's next short-squeeze target. The insurer's shares soared 32% in their highest volume trading day since April 19. Institutional investors are largely sitting on the sidelines as the meme-stock rally continues. Amateur investors, however, ""don't need a reason,"" said Michael O'Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading in Stamford, Connecticut. ""They're trying to do the same thing they did last week. It's a new week. They start over, the meme stock buyers, the wallstreetbets Reddit community.""              ",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amc-jumps-19-funds-eye-142037991.html
