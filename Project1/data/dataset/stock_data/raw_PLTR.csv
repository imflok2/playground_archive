2021-06-04T20:05:19.000Z,Activists Launch Campaign Against Palantir's NHS Collaboration: CNBC,"A self-touted tech-justice non-profit, Foxglove, has launched the “No Palantir in Our NHS” campaign to oppose data analytics company Palantir Technologies Inc’s (NYSE: PLTR) collaboration with U.K.’s National Health Service (NHS), CNBC reports. The campaign was backed by over 50 other organizations working on civil liberties, anti-racism, migrant justice, and public health. Palantir’s partnership with the NHS was aimed to help the government and health services use data to monitor the pandemic spread. The NHS COVID-19 Data Store contract allowed Palantir to help manage the data lake that contained everybody’s health data for pandemic purposes. During Mar. 2020, the contract was sold as a short-term effort to predict how best to deploy resources to deal with the pandemic. However, the contract was quietly extended in Dec. when the NHS and Palantir inked a £23 million ($34 million) two-year deal. Palantir is processing the patient data while the NHS remains the data owner, limiting Palantir’s activities. Facebook Inc (NASDAQ: FB) board member and Palantir co-founder Peter Thiel reportedly donated $1.25 million for Donald Trump’s Presidential campaign. Palantir had also faced flak for supporting spy agencies, border forces, and militaries. It has been linked with tracking down undocumented Americans to the development of unmanned drones for bombings and intelligence. Palantir has been trying to grow its European business in recent years and has a significant presence in London’s Soho neighborhood. The company failed to win any contract by lobbying the U.K. Department of Trade and health officials in 2019. The Financial Times reported Palantir’s recent acquisition of a stake in British health firm Babylon as part of a $4.2 billion blank-check deal. Price action: PLTR shares closed higher by 1.69% at $24.03 on Friday.

2021-06-04T18:11:43.000Z,"Palantir Backs Multiple SPACs Endeavors in Digital Health, Aviation, Robotic Sectors: CNBC","Data analytics software developer Palantir Technologies Inc (NYSE: PLTR) has emerged as a significant investor in other tech companies preparing for a public debut, CNBC reports. What Happened: A group of investors, including Palantir, will invest $230 million into the Babylon Health’s SPAC (special purpose acquisition company) merger transaction to go public, as announced on Thursday. Palantir investment was part of a longer-term partnership between the two companies, Babylon CEO Ali Parsa said. Palantir has now agreed to invest in at least six SPAC deals in less than three months. Tech companies like Alphabet Inc’s (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Google, Salesforce.com Inc (NYSE: CRM), and Intel Corp’s (NASDAQ: INTC) large venture capital arms back start-ups at various stages. Interestingly, Palantir is banking on more mature companies that are already valued in billions. Palantir is hunting innovative companies in big markets that can exploit its data tools. The SPAC listing momentum has cooled down over regulatory concerns and correction in tech stocks. The CNBC SPAC 50 index, based on market cap, has shed nearly 4% year-to-date, while Nasdaq has gained close to 6%. Why It Matters: Palantir has sponsored companies ranging from drug discovery to robotics and air transport. Last week, it collaborated with General Motors (NYSE: GM) in a $100 million investment in Wejo, a U.K.’s connected vehicle data system developer. In March, it agreed to invest $41 million in an air taxi company Lilium, which was developing a seven-seat, electric vertical takeoff and landing aircraft. Palantir grew up serving the public sector and was popular software and services provider to intelligence agencies. The company also expanded into the commercial sector, which accounted for close to 40% of revenue in Q1. Palantir was also heavily investing in the health side of its business. It appointed former International Business Machines Corp (NYSE: IBM) Watson Health executive Dr. Bill Kassler as its first U.S. government CMO. On May 1, Palantir agreed to invest $30 million into the SPAC for drugmaker Roivant Sciences. Roivant inked a five-year subscription contract for products and services under the arrangement.

2021-06-04T15:03:06.000Z,UK healthcare app built by Iranian refugee set for £3bn New York stock listing,"A British-Iranian entrepreneur who came to the UK as a teenage refugee is on track to become a billionaire from the listing of his business in the US. Babylon Health, a London-headquartered healthcare technology business, announced on Thursday night it would join New York's Nasdaq (^IXIC) stock market in a deal valuing the business at $4.2bn (£3bn).  Dr Ali Parsa, Babylon's founder, is set to reap a major windfall from the transaction. He debuted on the Sunday Times Rich List this year with an estimated net worth of £825m thanks to his ownership of just over half of Babylon's shares. The surge in valuation since then means his stake is now likely worth over £1bn. “Frankly, you shouldn’t believe everything you read and it’s irrelevant – they’re clearly counting more than I am counting,"" Dr Parsa told Yahoo Finance UK. ""But the reality is I have enough – even before Babylon as a retired investment banker I had enough money to live. The question is really what to do you do with your life."" Babylon's blockbuster stock market debut caps a remarkable career for Dr Parsa who came to Britain as a refugee in 1982 after fleeing the Islamic revolution in Iran. He arrived in Britain aged 16 with little to his name but Dr Parsa now downplays this difficult period in his life. ""Saying I was a refugee is kind of dramatising it a bit,"" he said. ""I was that, but I was lucky enough to be born in a very loving middle-class family and so by the time I left Iran at the age of 16, all the foundations were there."" Dr Parsa, 56, earned a place at UCL in the mid-1980s and went on to gain a doctorate in engineering physics. He then pursued a career in the City – working for Credit Suisse, Merrill Lynch, and Goldman Sachs – before founding a chain of hospitals, Circle Healthcare. He left the business in 2012 and set up Babylon a year later. The company works with the NHS in the UK to offer virtual GP consultations and uses artificial intelligence to help with healthcare. It expanded to the US last year where it has grown rapidly.       "
2021-06-04T14:44:35.000Z,Continue to Exercise Caution When it Comes to Palantir Stock,"Did Palantir (NYSE:PLTR) stock find its floor at price just under $20 per share? And, if so, can the data analytics play’s bounce back over the past few weeks continue? Yes and no. On one hand, last month’s pullback in hindsight may have more of a hiccup than the continuation of a move towards its $10 per share direct listing price. Source: Ascannio / Shutterstock.com Fears of rising inflation, and in turn, rising interest rates, which is bad for growth stocks, may have been what caused the stock’s brief drop below $20 per share. But, as investors start to shrug off these concerns, Palantir shares may have a path to soar back to $30 per share (and beyond). On the other hand, it’s not as if the coast is fully clear for growth names like this one. The higher rates of inflation we’ve seen in recent months could be here to stay. If so, the Federal Reserve may end up having to raise rates, as recently feared. This could result in valuation contraction for this richly-priced “hot stock.” InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Yet, that’s not the only thing that could knock shares down once again. Company-specific concerns, like slowing growth, could have a negative impact as well. So, what does that mean for investors interested in diving back in today? Stay cautious, as the recent rebound in hindsight could end being only a “dead cat bounce.” Enthusiasm for Palantir shares is still far away from hitting the off-the-charts levels experienced back in February. But, with its move from around $18 per share in mid-May, back up to around $23 per share today, it’s clear some investors are hopping in now, in hopes of getting in early for a second round of mania in this popular “meme stock.” 7 Best Vaccine Stocks for Their Pipeline Potential It’s understandable why investors are getting excited once again about PLTR stock. Revenue growth remains strong, as seen from its latest quarterly results. Its bread-and-butter governmental business continues to rack up contract wins as well. And, as InvestorPlace’s Chris MacDonald discussed Jun 1, the company’s talk about becoming exposed to Bitcoin (CCC:BTC-USD) has helped to boost interest in its shares as well.              "

2021-06-02T18:01:20.000Z,This is no longer our grandparents’ or parents’ stock market : Strategist,"Ryan Nauman, market strategist at Zephyr, joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss the meme stock boom and outlook on the market for the months ahead. ALEXIS CHRISTOFOROUS: A frenzy of buying of AMC stock triggered several trading halts today, with meme stock traders fueling a surge in that stock of more than 100%. The manic trading activity comes despite a report that a hedge fund had sold its stake in the movie theater company. Here to talk about those meme stocks and the market at large is Ryan Nauman, Market Strategist at Zephyr. Ryan, good to have you here. I want to start with the activity we're seeing in AMC today. We're also seeing a little bit of that bleeding over into Bed Bath and Beyond, another so-called meme stock. How much of a threat is this kind of trading to the broader stock market? RYAN NAUMAN: Alexis, first, thank you so much for having me on. It's such a fascinating question. And really, you know, it's been a fascinating story this whole year are the meme stocks. And to me, I don't know if it's so much of a threat to the markets. It's more of a learning experience. And my biggest takeaway from this year is that this is no longer our grandparents', or for that matter, our parents' stock market. Now, investment professionals, they need to start focusing more on looking at alternative data sets, you know, rethinking their investment thesis to consider this growing cohort of retail investors. These retail investors, because of day trading, and for the most part, because of this virtually free money that we've had from the Fed since the pandemic, that their voice is getting much larger due to social media, and they need to be considered when we are coming up with the investment thesis moving forward. And that's what we're seeing with AMC. AMC, the executives there, they're rewarding this retail cohorts with perks due to their fantastic run this year. I think they're up nearly 1,400% year to date, and they're getting rewarded for it. That's what we're going to see moving forward. And investment theses need to consider that moving forward.           "

We have just about a minute to go to the bell. I want to bring into the stream first, David Nelson, Belpointe Wealth Management, and Sarah House. She's the Wells Fargo senior economist. But first, let's get to the markets here and see what the day's price action has in store for us. Now, the Dow is the laggard of the day. But it is up half a percent here. You can see that's good for 183 points. S&P 500 up 9/10 of a percent-- look like it's at session highs or close to it right now. And the NASDAQ, big outperform of the day, up nearly 1 and 1/2%. We'll get a check inside the NASDAQ 100 where we see the mega caps still holding onto some nice gains. Off their highs a little bit, but check out Microsoft, up 2%. Alphabet and Apple, just a little bit less than that. And what stands out is Tesla. Tesla's up 4 and 1/2%, pulling back some of those nasty losses it had in the rest of the big week. Also, look at Nvidia. That stock up 3 and 1/2% to another record high. And as we march towards that closing bell, just a quick look at the sector action for the day. We got tech and communication services, the big outperformers They are-- [BELL RINGING] [MUSIC PLAYING] SEANA SMITH: And that wraps up the trading week again. We're looking at gains across the board.

The NASDAQ was the outperformer for the entire trading day closing up 1 and 1/2%, building on the gains that we saw yesterday. We have David Nelson and Sarah House here with us to break down the action that we saw not only in the markets side, but also what we've seen through econ data. David, let me send it over to you first, because when you take a look at the market's reaction, it looks like the market was satisfied with this report even though it came in slightly weaker than what the Street was initially expecting to see. From your view, though, was it strong enough, or is it strong enough for where we should be at this point in this recovery?                            "

Following the first-quarter results, RBC Capital analyst Matthew Hedberg reiterated a Hold rating and decreased the price target from $27 to $20 (12.9% downside potential) on the stock.

The company's primary customer for its first two decades of operation has been the United States Government, through its Gotham platform. Now the company is investing heavily in growing its Foundry platform, which services medium and large sized companies. It is also growing its Gotham platform to include a greater piece of the United States Government’s spending as well as defense contractors and allied governments. (See Palantir stock analysis on TipRanks) Growing Rapidly The main value for PLTR currently comes from its world-class data analytics and artificial intelligence platforms. These enable government agencies and corporations to manage, extract significant value from, and optimize large troves of data. They also provide a very rapid and user-friendly data integration and set-up experience. As a result of the value they add to an organization as well as the mission critical nature of their industry, Palantir is able to command significant switching costs, and therefore enjoys pricing power and sticky customer relationships that often see contracts expand over time. The company is experiencing rapid growth across its businesses, particularly in the United States, and management is investing aggressively to recruit and retain the best engineers and sales personnel. It is striving to deliver the highest quality product possible while also scaling the business as rapidly as they can. They company seeks to gain a larger portion of the pie of its ~$120 billion total addressable market. Currently, it has only ~1% of that total market, so the company enjoys a massive growth runway. Management projects that the company will grow by at least 30% per year for the foreseeable future, which should enable it to become the major – if not dominant – data analytics players in its target markets by the end of this decade.

2021-05-28T14:57:10.000Z,Palantir Is a Better Conviction Long Than Short,"Palantir (NYSE:PLTR) stock is trying to make a comeback. Don’t feel bad for it since it’s still up 140%, which is five times more than the S&P 500. Source: Ascannio / Shutterstock.com Recently the bulls suffered a blow going into the earnings. It is relatively weak because it has shed 60% of its value from the January highs. The dip was an absolute opportunity to buy into it or add to current positions. Consider that my not-so-secret conclusion and I will back up my story next. There are a few dozen stocks that are the weapons in the Reddit versus hedge funds battle. PLTR falls on and off it, so it is messing with the natural price path of a quality stock. The January super-spike artificially exhausted the buyers. The bulls are still trying to recover from it and rebuild the base for long-term success. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Yesterday the battle flared and AMC (NYSE:AMC) exploded 35% in hours. Palantir was part of the group to a degree and rose 3% on no news. Here is the little secret that should give investors confidence. The opinions in social media do not impact the actual results that the company delivers. Invest based on facts not perceptions. The Palantir profit-and-loss statement shows their progress in black and white. There is no speculation in knowing that they have $1.2 billion reasons a year to be optimistic. They doubled their total revenues since 2018. The company still loses money but that’s part of being a growing business. Profitability is not as an important a statistic as growth. It is not cheap and it doesn’t need to be, just ask those who invested in Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) early. Impressive growth does not come cheap, and those who skimp will get mediocre results at best. Investors should watch the Palantir management team members in action. Their investor events are impressive and they exude confidence. The company has two different revenue streams. One side serves the government and another for the commercial sector. They are both healthy and growing. Artificial intelligence is now more important than ever. The world has been casually chasing digitization for decades, but the pandemic made it an emergency. Suddenly everyone’s in a panic to get digital.               "

2021-05-26T18:02:13.000Z,Facebook Board Rejects Proposals to Curb Zuckerberg’s Power,"(Bloomberg) -- Facebook Inc. rejected two proposals intended to diminish Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg’s control over the company, an expected though disappointing outcome for those worried about the CEO’s power. The board Wednesday turned down a proposal to replace Zuckerberg as chairman with an independent representative. Zuckerberg, who has served as chairman since 2012, controls about 58% of the voting shares, according to a regulatory filing. During Facebook’s annual meeting, the board also rejected a proposal to eliminate the special class of super-voting shares that gives Zuckerberg a controlling stake in the company. Under the plan, investors would have been awarded one vote per share. The Zuckerberg-controlled board has rejected similar motions in years past. While not surprising, the votes are likely to frustrate shareholders who argue Zuckerberg has too much power at a time Facebook needs more independent oversight to address its regulatory threats, privacy scandals and public controversies. Facebook also agreed to reappoint its current slate of board directors including Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg and Palantir Technologies Inc. co-founder Peter Thiel.

2021-05-25T07:57:36.000Z,Palantir Strengthens Ties with U.S Space Force,"Palantir Technologies (PLTR) has expanded its strategic partnership with the U.S. Space Force and U.S. Air Force, proving its ability to offer cutting-edge technologies. As part of the new deal, the company will provide software for powering advanced critical missions. Palantir is a software company specializing in big data analytics. Additionally, Palantir will use its Data-as-a-Service (DaaS) platform to support the Space Command and Control program. The company's solutions will also provide senior leadership at the Air Force with an analytics platform that merges data sources from across the Service. The total value of the contract is $32.5 million. “Palantir’s technology and framework has truly accelerated our ability to remove data stovepipes throughout the community and create actionable knowledge,"" said Col. Jennifer Krolikowski, Senior Materiel Leader for Space C2 at the Air Force Space and Missile Systems Center. Palantir boasts of a long tradition of working with the armed forces. In 2020, it worked with the Space Force and provided data support for the space command and control modernization program. (See Palantir stock analysis on TipRanks) Goldman Sachs analyst Christopher Merwin has reiterated a Buy rating on Palantir in the wake of the company's reporting 49% revenue growth year-over-year in Q1. According to the analyst, the impressive first quarter was due to strong U.S. business even as headwinds lingered on the international scene. Merwin stated, “We were encouraged to see that the commercial business added 11 new customers in the quarter, as Palantir’s efforts to broaden distribution for its Foundry platform are already paying off. As the company adds more GSI partners and continues to modularize Foundry, we expect to see a sustainably higher pace of customer additions going forward.” However, the analyst has cut his stock price target to $30 from $34 due to multiple compression in comparable companies. That price target implies 41.38% upside potential to current levels.       "

2021-05-20T16:43:34.000Z,Palantir vs. Splunk: Which Data Analytics Stock Is A Better Pick?,"Investors are increasingly showing interest in data analytics stocks. Data is used in different ways in organizations, from revamping their marketing strategy to understanding customers better and personalizing content. Data analytics software companies help organizations make sense of this data and use it effectively. According to a Market Research Future (MRFR) report from earlier this year, the global data analytics market is expected to be worth $132.9 billion by 2026, indicating a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 28.9% from 2016 to 2026. Using the TipRanks Stock Comparison tool, let us compare two data analytics companies, Palantir Technologies, and Splunk, and see how Wall Street analysts feel about these stocks. Palantir Technologies (PLTR) Palantir Technologies is a data analytics company that has developed two data analytics platforms, Gotham and Foundry. Gotham specifically addresses the needs of the intelligence sector and enables such customers to identify patterns in datasets. Meanwhile, Foundry addresses the data analytics needs of companies. 61% of PLTR’s customers were government agencies at the end of Q1 while commercial customers made up the remaining 39%.

Average revenue per customer increased 29% year-over-year to $8.1 million during the trailing twelve months ending on March 31. However, Palantir expects the growth rate for average revenue per customer to slow down as it targets customers across different segments, particularly the middle market and small-to-medium business enterprises (SMBs) in a bid to broaden its customer base. In the second quarter, PLTR expects revenues to grow 43% year-over-year to $360 million. The company anticipates revenues to rise at a rate of 30% or more annually from 2021 through 2025.                  "

2021-05-18T15:36:44.000Z,Palantir Still Looks Weak,"Palantir rose, moving toward its 50-day line. But the chart still looks weak … fourth miniuptrend. Others quickly fizzled. Even if it gets above the 50-day line and short-term peaks, still far, far below record highs. Better to wait for stock to build right side of base and break out from proper base. Even in that case, PLTR and many other former leaders would have very deep bases. Less likely to work – and no bear market to blame it on! [MUSIC PLAYING] - What about exposure for recent or relatively recent IPOs? We had Palantir, ticker PLTR, out last fall. Had a huge move. IPO has a compelling story here. You know, investors may be thinking, oh, it's found a bottom. I can try to get it on sale here. Well off of that 45 level that it once hit at the beginning of the year. What do you think about that? That's definitely not our style of putting the odds in your favor. - I mean, it's not unusual to see little bounces. It doesn't mean that they're going to continue. I mean it may continue, but it's still below the [INAUDIBLE] line, and you can look as you're drawn like those are little places where it bounced up. Looks like it's gaining some momentum. Runs up towards the 50-day line, and then it fizzles out. Now even if it gets above the 50-day line or even gets up to 28 or so, gets up some short term levels, it's still well below the record highs. I mean this is just, it's probably going to take months for a stock like this to recover. And it could rebound faster, but it's like just the odds are not in your favor. It's still sort of in this downtrend. It hasn't broken that. You know, it's just not as [? interesting. ?] I know people, it's exciting. These stocks do move up when they move up, but boy, they move down fast, too. And so you just have to look at what is actually leading the market, not was a winner last year. - Exactly. We're not trying to catch the exact bottom. We're trying to put the odds in our favor. And history tells us that the strongest stocks are in uptrends. They will form some sort of consolidation or pullback, and launch big moves from there. So we like looking for those types of setups and maybe one day we'll see that with Palantir. Who knows? But it'll take a while, like you said. There's a lot of damage to this chart, and in the Enterprise group, as a whole, as well, which is a bit disappointing. So much great leadership came from that group last year. But as we were saying on IBD Live this morning, who would have thought that we would this year be focusing on oil and gas stocks? There was a time where in the not too distant past where those were really out of favor. So that's why we like to keep track of sector rotation."

2021-05-16T09:06:53.000Z,Palantir Stock: This One Could Require Some Patience,"Palantir Technologies (PLTR), which is a top provider of analytics and AI (artificial intelligence) services and technology, saw its stock drop ten days in a row prior its earnings report this past week. Of course, this is nothing new for high-growth stocks lately. Wall Street has been dumping most of these securities. Palantir stock did get some relief when it reported its Q1 results on May 11. On the news, shares jumped nearly 10% to $20.21. Yet it was not able to hold on, and the stock price has since sunk to around $20, bringing the market capitalization to $37 billion. Q1 Results So, let’s get a rundown on the Q1 numbers. The company reported a net loss of $123 million or 7 cents a share. On an adjusted basis, the earnings per share was 4 cents, which was in-line with the consensus forecast. As for revenues, they soared 49% to $341.2 million, which handily beat the Street estimate of $332 million. The biggest driver was the U.S. government business, which saw an 83% spike. (See Palantir Technologies stock analysis on TipRanks) Note that when Palantir was founded – back in 2003 – the focus was generally on contracts for the CIA and the Defense Department. However, over the past decade, the company has been moving more aggressively into the commercial sector. In Q1, commercial segment revenues were $133 million. Something else to consider about the quarterly results: Palantir said that it will accept Bitcoin from its customers and might even add this digital asset to its balance. As seen recently with Tesla (TSLA), this may prove to be a challenge. Tesla recently indicated it will no longer accept Bitcoin for orders because of concerns about the environmental impact of the digital mining. Palantir's Technological Advantage Palantir generally caters to larger enterprise customers, as the average revenue per customer is about $8.1 million. In fact, the top 20 customers are at a hefty $36.1 million. Additionally, the company has been able to scale its operations with proprietary technologies. The latest offering is Apollo for Edge AI. Launched in April, it is already getting traction. At the heart of this system is micro models, which are similar to microservices that allow for modern cloud computing. The technology essentially makes it much easier and more effective to deploy AI models across complex environments.         "
2021-05-15T20:43:28.000Z,Soros Bought Up Stocks Linked to Bill Hwang’s Archegos Implosion,"(Bloomberg) -- Billionaire George Soros’s investment firm snapped up shares of ViacomCBS, Discovery and Baidu as they were being sold off in massive blocks during the collapse of Bill Hwang’s Archegos Capital Management. Soros Fund Management bought $194 million of ViacomCBS Inc., Baidu Inc. stock valued at $77 million, as well $46 million of Vipshop Holdings Ltd. and $34 million of Tencent Music Entertainment Group during the first quarter, according to a regulatory filing released Friday. A person familiar with the fund’s trading said the company didn’t hold the shares prior to Archegos’s implosion. Archegos, the family office of former hedge fund manager Hwang, fell apart during the last week of March after amassing large leveraged positions in a concentrated portfolio of U.S. and Chinese companies. At its peak, the family office had more than $20 billion of capital and total bets exceeding $100 billion. Hwang was wiped out in just days after investments including ViacomCBS and Discovery tumbled, triggering margin calls from global banks, who then sold the stocks in the big block trades. The fiasco is expected to cost the finance industry about $10 billion, has prompted an investigation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and caused heads to roll at Credit Suisse Group AG, where the hit exceeds $5 billion. The 13F filing provides one of the first examples of how a hedge fund attempted to capitalize on the distressed remains of Archegos. It also offers an insight into Soros’s investment firm, which is run by Chief Investment Officer Dawn Fitzpatrick. She told Bloomberg in March that she was willing to jump on dislocations in the market, investing $4 billion during the pandemic-induced swoon a year ago, including buying residential mortgages on the cheap. Soros returned almost 30% in the 12 months through February and manages $27 billion across a range of strategies. “When there’s a dislocation, we’re prepared to not just double down but triple down when the facts and circumstances support that,” Fitzpatrick, 51, said in a “Front Row” interview on Bloomberg TV.

2021-05-14T13:57:41.000Z,No Spycraft Needed to Buy Palantir,"There’s being right, well kinda sorta. And then there’s long and wrong. Or maybe not. And when it comes to Palantir Technologies (NYSE:PLTR), it’s both. What’s that mean? Let’s dive into what’s happening off and on the price chart of PLTR stock to figure that out, then offer a risk-adjusted determination aligned with those findings. Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com It’s been called a risky casino stock. It’s also been wagered as one of the next big things in tech. Since debuting on the NYSE this past September, PLTR stock has had no shortage of bears and bulls. Most famously, the secretive big data operative has pitted well-watched short-seller Citron Research versus 2020’s top fund manager, Ark Invest’s Cathie Wood. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips This past week and a way’s removed from a short recommendation with shares near $32, it was Citron’s $20 price target which turned into a reality. PLTR stock’s unwind, of course, isn’t unique. In today’s increasingly less tolerant environment for higher multiple growth stories, locating a crashed stock is akin to catching fish in a barrel. It’s easy. DraftKings (NYSE:DKNG). Churchill Capital (NYSE:CCIV). Zoom Video (NASDAQ:ZM). Still, a call of $20 is $20, right? Actually, the saying “a day late and dollar short” should emphatically come to mind. 10 Dividend Aristocrat Stocks for Your Reliability Short List Citron’s bold short target also had a time stamp tied to the end of last year. It was specific to say the least. Moreover, PLTR stock’s low of $21.15 in the immediate short recommendation aftermath missed the price objective by just over a buck. But who’s counting, right? Hopefully, nobody. By late January shares of PLTR reached a new all-time-high of $45. Bottom line, if the December low in Palantir was a “good enough for government work” situation for Citron to call it a profitable day, it appears we’ll never know. At least not in a timely manner. Mum has been the convenient word since late November’s short warning and front man Andrew Left busy pitching new ideas on other stocks.                "
2021-05-13T19:49:48.000Z,Celularity looks to advance cellular therapies with Palantir ,"Dr. Robert Hariri, Celularity CEO, joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss the outlook on the evolution of cellular medicine. ALEXIS CHRISTOFOROUS: The clinical stage biotech company Celularity has joined forces with Palantir, introducing artificial intelligence into its pursuit of cancer treatments with patented cellular medicine. The company is also going through a de-SPACing process, which is really just the next step in merging with a SPAC. Joining us now is Dr. Robert Hariri, Celularity CEO. We're also joined by our health care correspondent, Anjalee Khemlani. Dr. Hariri, good to have you here on the show. Let's start with this partnership with Palantir. What will you be able to do now that you've partnered with this company? And I'm also curious if they've taken an equity stake in Celularity. ROBERT HARIRI: Well, first of all, thank you very much for having me. As you know, Palantir is an absolute world leader in the creation of software systems that compile data, decisions, operational information, and help companies create efficiencies that heretofore didn't exist. So in our industry, cellular medicine is still, to be quite candid, in its infancy. There's a tremendous amount to be learned by interrogating the biology of the source material that comprises the cellular medicines and also understanding the biological activity-- the the performance in manufacturing, the performance clinically, and then using that data to make decisions about selecting products for different diseases, how to administer them, and ultimately, how to present them to the regulatory community for things like registrations. ANJALEE KHEMLANI: Dr, Anjalee here. So let's talk about that, because, obviously, the idea of AI in health care is really growing. And different companies have tried different ways. We know that IBM Watson Health, for example, struggled in some ways. So what makes this different? And what specifically are you hoping to get out of it that can actually help the end consumer?             "

2021-05-12T12:33:22.000Z,Palantir Stock Bears the Brunt of a Price Target Cut,"Big data contractor Palantir (PLTR) had a big day Tuesday, reporting tremendous growth both in revenues (up 49% year-over-year) and in losses -- up 127% year-over-year. For its fiscal first quarter 2021, Palantir recorded revenue of $341.2 million. Losses were only $0.07 per diluted share, less than the $0.10 per diluted share reported a year ago, when the company was still private, and about equal to Wall Street estimates. However, those losses were spread out across many more new shares created during the IPO. On a pure ""net loss"" basis, Palantir lost $123.5 million for the quarter, more than twice what it lost in last year's Q1. Most investors didn't care one bit. Focusing on Palantir's revenue growth, which exceeded analyst expectations, and on the company's prediction that Q4 revenues will be even stronger -- and again, ahead of analyst estimates -- investors bid up Palantir stock 9% through Tuesday's closing bell. And yet, not everyone was totally impressed. In a note out after earnings, RBC Capital's 5-star analyst Matthew Hedberg reiterated his lukewarm ""sector perform"" rating on Palantir stock, and to emphasize the point, reduced his price target on the shares to just $20. (To watch Hedberg's track record, click here) As the analyst explained, Palantir's revenue outperformance was indeed ""solid"" in Q1, and the company did indeed guide for better-than-expected revenue in Q2 as well. Palantir even performed well on the free cash flow front, generating ""adjusted"" free cash flow of $151 million in the quarter, and promising to at least maintain that, closing out the year north of $150 million in adjusted free cash flow as well. Margins are also improving. Palantir's 34% operating profit margin was a good 11 percentage points higher than management had told investors to expect -- and ""the company continues to innovate such as with Edge AI,"" admitted Hedberg. And overall, ""Palantir's 1Q was a good start to the year.""      "

2021-05-11T22:18:03.000Z,"Palantir Rallies on Sales Forecast, Embrace of Bitcoin","(Bloomberg) -- Palantir Technologies Inc. expects sales to grow 43% in the second quarter, showing new distribution deals are putting its data analysis software into the hands of more customers. Revenue will reach $360 million in the period ending in June, the company said in a statement Tuesday. Shares gained 9.4% to close at $20.21 in New York. With more cash flowing in, the Denver-based company said it’s embracing a newer form of currency: Bitcoin. Palantir accepts customer payments in Bitcoin and is debating whether to use company cash to purchase the asset, Chief Financial Officer David Glazer said on a conference call with analysts. Such a move would follow similar ones by Square Inc. and Tesla Inc., which helped drive a surge in Bitcoin prices. The results provided some signs of encouragement after a prolonged slump for the company. At the close of trading Monday, the shares had reached their lowest point in almost six months, reflecting a sharp turn away from technology stocks by investors worldwide over concerns about inflation. Co-founders Peter Thiel and Alex Karp started Palantir with a focus on providing tools and consulting to the U.S. and allied governments. Palantir has overhauled its software in recent years to court more businesses and lower prices for customers. The company has placed a great deal of emphasis on growth, which shows in the results. In the first quarter, revenue increased 49% to $341 million, beating estimates. However, Palantir said compensation costs ballooned, contributing to a loss in the first quarter that was wider than expected. The loss was 7 cents a share as stock-based compensation more than tripled in the period that ended in March. Palantir said it signed 11 new commercial customers during the quarter and invested in two customers with long term potential: Sarcos Robotics and aviation startup Lilium. Chief Operating Officer Shyam Sankar said both companies built operations around Palantir’s Foundry software “from day zero.” “Manufacturing is a huge focus for us and one of deep strength,” he said.

2021-05-11T15:38:23.000Z,"Roblox surges, Palantir reverses up, UWM Holdings falls","Julie Hyman, Brian Sozzi, and Myles Udland discuss some of Tuesday’s market movers. Palantir recovers earlier losses, UWM extends losses and Roblox continues to build momentum. MYLES UDLAND: Hi. Welcome back to ""Yahoo Finance Live"" on this Tuesday morning. Let's take a look at the markets here. And we are continuing to see the markets trade in tandem and trade to the downside. All three majors now off a uniform 1.7%. And it does appear, guys, that as Loretta Mester, Cleveland Fed President, was speaking with Brian Cheung on our air, the markets started to lose some steam. Julie, earlier today, we saw futures down when we came on the air. Then we saw a little bit of a bid-- quite a bit of a bid-- in a number of those names that had been under pressure. But now once again, it does appear that the selling has indeed resumed here as we get through the trading session. JULIE HYMAN: Yeah. And from where I sit, it looks like the selling is pretty widespread, broad-based, in different categories. Whereas earlier, we were talking about the tech was taking the worst of it, and we were seeing the NASDAQ down the most, now, as you can see, all three major averages are down a lot. But you've got stocks like Apple that are down by more than 2.5%, looking at our most actives list. Tesla also on that list, as are some of the CHIPs. But then you also have Ford Motor Company down 2% and American Airlines down 4.7%, Bank of America down 1%. So that implies that we are seeing it not just concentrated in what's going on in big tech anymore, but really more across the board here. So it's an interesting phenomenon. We'll see if we get another zag after the zigzag that we've already gotten in today's session and see if it becomes more confined. But for right now-- and by the way, we should mention we got the VIX up as well at the highs in session. MYLES UDLAND: Yeah. And speaking of those zags, really, let's take a look at one name that we've discussed today and really caught our eye this morning. That's Palantir. The stock was up 10% this morning after the company came out with its latest quarterly results. It was a beat, as most results have been over the last earnings period. The stock was down double digits. Now the stock was up about 6%. We see it's now up about 3%. This is a name that is in a number of those ARK funds. Palantir is also a name that really became a meme stock-- one of the original diamond hand stocks, I guess we could say-- back in January and February.          "
2021-05-11T15:13:08.000Z,"UPDATE 3-Palantir allows payments in bitcoin, mulls investing in cryptocurrencies","(Adds details on bitcoin, updates shares)    May 11 (Reuters) - Palantir Technologies Inc, a Peter Thiel-backed U.S. analytics company, said on Tuesday it had started accepting bitcoin as payment from customers and was also considering investing in cryptocurrencies.    This comes as the world's biggest cyrptocurrency continues to gain acceptance across Wall Street with companies like Tesla Inc allowing customers to buy vehicles with bitcoin. The electric-car maker also bought $1.5 billion worth of bitcoin earlier this year, propelling its prices to record highs.    Palantir, which beat first-quarter revenue after clinching large deals from government agencies and large corporations, saw its shares rise about 4% in volatile trading after falling more than 9% premarket.    The company said it expects current-quarter revenue to rise 43% to $360 million. Analysts were expecting $344.31 million, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.    Known mainly for its work with U.S. government defense and intelligence agencies including the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency, Palantir enables customers to integrate their data with its software platforms, which helps them get an analytical view of their operations.    Palantir, co-founded in 2003 by billionaire Thiel who endorsed Donald Trump in the 2016 U.S. presidential elections, has courted its share of controversies with analysts and experts questioning its valuation and raising privacy concerns around the data the company has access to.    The company's revenue rose 49% to $341.2 million in the first quarter, above estimates of $332.23 million, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

2021-05-11T13:52:03.000Z,Tech stocks extend losses,"On Tuesday, major tech companies continued to sell off following Monday’s losses. Julie Hyman, Brian Sozzi, and Myles Udland break down the factors contributing to the price action in big tech. MYLES UDLAND: Let's take a look at futures this morning. We are seeing stocks under some pressure. NASDAQ futures now off more than 2%. Dow futures falling in sympathy. We've seen the Dow hold up quite all right amid pressure in the tech sector, but we are seeing selling once again in tech names and bringing down the broader market this morning. At the center of the action, once again we see Cathie Woods Ark Invest, the Ark Innovation ETF, ARKK the main ETF within the suite of products offered by ARK. Off some 5% in free market trading. ARKK is now down right around 40% from its highs. And you look at some of the biggest components in that index, names like Spotify, Square, Roku, of course, Tesla, all of those names continuing under pressure here as we get started in today's trading session. Looking over at what's going on with the pipeline story, Colonial Pipeline looking to restore services by the end of the week after that ransomware cyber attack took operations offline over the weekend. The group responsible saying yesterday that they were sorry for the attack. We take a look at gasoline futures right now as folks get ready for the summer driving season, and they are under just a little bit of pressure. But let's begin with that selloff in the tech sector. We have seen a couple episodes, a couple of bouts let's say, as they like to say in the market world, of tech selling over the last couple of months. The last time that we started to see this group under pressure, we were cooling off from the GameStop saga, the true beginning of the meme market or maybe we could say that late January, early February period was some version of the end of the meme market. But here we are some three months later, we had the indexes hitting record highs just a couple of weeks ago. And Sozzi, now we come back and we discussed the risk in this market of the economy continuing to reopen, people having other things to do, the growth styles so prominent within this group really falling out of favor among investors. We discussed all these risks, but to see the moves in some of these names, I mean Palantir, we can talk about that stock. Off 10% after its earnings. The pressure is really on here in this market.             "

2021-05-07T14:26:26.000Z,Palantir CEO’s Billion-Dollar Payday Is Hardly Worth It,"Palantir (NYSE:PLTR) filed its fiscal 2020 proxy on April 29. It shows that CEO and co-founder Alex Karp’s total compensation this past year was $1.1 billion, much of it in PLTR stock options and awards. Source: Ascannio / Shutterstock.com While Peter Thiel, one of the company’s largest shareholders, probably thinks he’s worth it, I doubt it very much. Here’s why. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Supporters of the data analytics software company would likely argue that the amounts listed in the proxy for stock awards and option awards in 2020 – $296.4 million and $797.9 million, respectively – have yet to be earned. They are merely an estimate of what they would be worth today were they available for vesting and exercisable. In fact, if you exclude those awards, he really only made $4.3 million, much of that for additional security and use of the company aircraft. He’s really just a pauper when you look at it from that perspective. I’m facetious, of course. 7 Hot Stocks to Consider for a Greener Future No CEO, even a co-founder, deserves this kind of payday. And let’s not forget that Karp actually made $48.7 million in 2020 from 2.57 million shares exercised from previous option awards that vested during the year. You can find that tidbit on Page 42 of the proxy. So, he really made $53 million in 2020. I could get by on that. Now, consider that as of April 16, Karp held 5.1% of Palantir’s outstanding stock, or 81.48 million shares, for an economic interest of 4.3%. Today, as I write this, those shares are worth $1.76 billion. This is something that drives me nuts about corporate America. Either you’re a paid gunslinger, and options and awards are the carrots to get you to stay long-term, or you’re one of the founders, and your compensation has already been plentiful. You shouldn’t receive both. In reality, it’s a betrayal of shareholders, not to mention most of the employees.                 "

2021-05-06T11:08:11.000Z,How Will Palantir's (PLTR) Top Line Shape Up in Q1 Earnings?,"Palantir Technologies Inc. PLTR will report first-quarter 2021 results on May 11. The company’s top line is expected to have performed well in the quarter, driven by increased scale and efficiency of its three-phase business model that engages acquire-phase, expand-phase and scale-phase customers. Both government and commercial segments are anticipated to do well, driven by these strengths. Palantir’s acquire-phase customers generate less than $100,000 a year. Expand-phase customers generate greater than $100,000 a year with negative contribution margins, and require significant investments from the company for scaling themselves up and growing revenues. Customers in scale phase generate greater than $100,000 a year along with positive contribution margins. Palantir Technologies Inc. price-eps-surprise | Palantir Technologies Inc. Quote In the to-be-reported quarter, we expect Palantir to have seen revenue growth through the addition of new acquire-phase customers. Expand-phase revenues are expected to have benefited from increased adoption of software, while increased contributions from existing customers are likely to have helped the scale phase. Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues in the to-be-reported quarter is pegged at $333 million, indicating 3.4% sequential growth. Palantir currently carries a Zacks Rank 3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here. Equifax’s EFX first-quarter 2021 adjusted earnings of $1.97 per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 29.6% and increased on a year-over-year basis.

The company delivered an earnings surprise of 250% in the fourth quarter of 2020. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $333 million, indicating 3.4% sequential growth. The top line is expected to have benefited from strength in both government and commercial segments. Both segments are likely to have benefited from increased contributions from both existing and new customers. The consensus mark for earnings is pegged at 4 cents, indicating a sharp decline from 7 cents reported in the fourth quarter. Increasing expenses are likely to have weighed on the bottom line as the company continues to invest in growing headcount and channel partnerships, as well as in research and development. Our proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Palantir this time around.

2021-05-04T16:10:04.000Z,Why the Earnings Surprise Streak Could Continue for Palantir Technologies Inc. (PLTR),"If you are looking for a stock that has a solid history of beating earnings estimates and is in a good position to maintain the trend in its next quarterly report, you should consider Palantir Technologies Inc. (PLTR). This company, which is in the Zacks Technology Services industry, shows potential for another earnings beat. This company has an established record of topping earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 187.50%. For the most recent quarter, Palantir Technologies Inc. Was expected to post earnings of $0.02 per share, but it reported $0.07 per share instead, representing a surprise of 250%. For the previous quarter, the consensus estimate was $0.04 per share, while it actually produced $0.09 per share, a surprise of 125%. Price and EPS Surprise Thanks in part to this history, there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for Palantir Technologies Inc. Lately. In fact, the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) for the stock is positive, which is a great indicator of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank. Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven. The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier. Palantir Technologies Inc. Has an Earnings ESP of +0% at the moment, suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near-term earnings potential. When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner. The company's next earnings report is expected to be released on May 11, 2021.    "
2021-05-04T15:30:03.000Z,Is Palantir Technologies (PLTR) Stock Outpacing Its Business Services Peers This Year?,"The Business Services group has plenty of great stocks, but investors should always be looking for companies that are outperforming their peers. Palantir Technologies (PLTR) is a stock that can certainly grab the attention of many investors, but do its recent returns compare favorably to the sector as a whole? One simple way to answer this question is to take a look at the year-to-date performance of PLTR and the rest of the Business Services group's stocks. Palantir Technologies is one of 223 individual stocks in the Business Services sector. Collectively, these companies sit at #8 in the Zacks Sector Rank. The Zacks Sector Rank gauges the strength of our 16 individual sector groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups. The Zacks Rank is a proven model that highlights a variety of stocks with the right characteristics to outperform the market over the next one to three months. The system emphasizes earnings estimate revisions and favors companies with improving earnings outlooks. PLTR is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for PLTR's full-year earnings has moved 29.63% higher within the past quarter. This is a sign of improving analyst sentiment and a positive earnings outlook trend. Based on the latest available data, PLTR has gained about -5.31% so far this year. In comparison, Business Services companies have returned an average of 1.59%. This means that Palantir Technologies is performing better than its sector in terms of year-to-date returns.

2021-04-30T17:06:48.000Z,Palantir Is Poised to Win More Commercial Clients,"Shares of Palantir Technologies (NYSE:PLTR) have shed over 27% of their value since Feb. 12 when I last wrote about the artificial intelligence company. You might be wondering if this is a good time to buy PLTR stock. Source: Ascannio / Shutterstock.com As I mentioned in my previous article, it’s not a simple call. There are a lot of reasons to be optimistic about Palantir and a few other reasons to be worried. Overall, I think it is worth a spot on your growth stock watchlist thanks to the growth potential that its enterprise push promises. Before going into further detail on Palantir’s enterprise push, it’s worth mentioning that the recent selloff isn’t down to any fundamental-shifting event on the AI company’s part. The primary driving factor has been investors’ move away from growth stocks (especially the so-called Covid economy stocks) to value stocks. The chart below shows the price performance of a few Covid growth stocks since Feb. 12. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Palantir started in 2004 with an initial focus on selling a fraud-detection tool that finds relationships between disparate data sets. The company attracted the interest of government agencies and would onboard government clients, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation, U.S. Special Forces and international intelligence agencies, according to a 2018 Wall Street Journal report. The company’s government business has grown stronger, accounting for more than half of its revenue in 2020. Palantir has made no secret of its intention to diversify its customer base away from a reliance on governments to include enterprise clients. But it appeared to have found little luck until recently. The WSJ report cited above touched on some of the company’s unsuccessful shots at winning more corporate customers. Several factors typically contribute to these outcomes. However, the overarching feeling is that Palantir wasn’t professional enough for corporate clients.                 "

2021-04-16T18:03:31.000Z,Hold Off on Palantir Stock Until Enthusiasm Returns,"Since last November, it’s been investor perception rather than fundamentals driving price action in Palantir (NYSE:PLTR) stock. Trying to value this big data company’s shares using traditional valuation metrics has thus far been a fool’s errand. Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com You can say the stock’s rich valuation is built on its impressive growth projections. But, I would wager more of that has to do with qualitative factors. Namely, its deep ties with the U.S. Federal Government. In addition, the perception that Palantir has cutting edge proprietary technology. Many remain bullish on the stock based on these two factors. But enthusiasm is no longer at levels seen a few months back. And, as analysts poke more holes in its bull case and recent contracts do little to move its share price, there may be additional downward pressure ahead. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips 10 Stocks to Buy for Your $5K Robinhood Portfolio Sure, that’s not set in stone. The company may be able to deliver sufficient results, and new developments, that help support today’s valuation. But if you’re expecting a quick rebound to its all-time highs, don’t hold your breath. It’s going to take some time for this once hot stock to take off once again. At first glance, the bull case for Palantir shares makes sense. There’s plenty to signal it has a big advantage over rival data analytics firms when it comes to business with the federal government. Over time, as defense, national security, and civilian agencies depend more on data than firepower/manpower, it’s names like this one that will lock down a larger share of federal contracts. So far, investors have perceived this to mean the company can continue to grow at a 30%+ clip. But, as I’ve written previously, it’s uncertain whether that’s going to be the case. Its growth in the governmental space may stall out sooner than expected. With that, it’ll need its commercial segment to help pick up the slack.                "

2021-04-12T10:00:00.000Z,Oracle’s Years-Long Washington Offense Ends in Trio of Defeats,"(Bloomberg) -- Oracle Corp. Executive Chairman Larry Ellison has spent the better part of a decade waging battle in U.S. courts and forging political alliances in Washington to win lucrative business and thwart adversaries.It’s all part of a high-stakes gamble to revive Oracle’s anemic revenue growth, which has averaged about 1% a year since 2012, and regain relevance in the face of a widening phalanx of upstarts eroding the company’s dominance in the business software market. Ellison’s effort suffered a stinging setback last week when the U.S. Supreme Court, in a landmark decision, found Alphabet Inc.’s Google legitimately used Oracle-owned Java software to develop the Android mobile operating system. The ruling capped a 10-year lawsuit and blocked a $9 billion windfall to Oracle. It followed earlier stalled efforts to secure a military contract worth $10 billion and a potentially lucrative cloud deal with social media marvel TikTok.The trio of defeats underscore the limits of a strategy that relied on Oracle’s ties to the Trump White House and other politicians and ratchet up the pressure on Ellison and Chief Executive Officer Safra Catz to find ways to keep the existing product lineup vital. “They’re just throwing everything against the wall at this point to see what sticks,” said Anurag Rana, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. But to improve its fortunes, Oracle will have to focus on the fundamentals of its software business. “The big issue for them is how to revive growth and it does not look like much is happening on that front,” he added. Despite its sprawling product lineup of software, services and data-center hardware, Oracle is simple to understand. At the end of the 1970s, Ellison pioneered a new way of storing and processing information – the Oracle relational database. The program vaulted the company to the forefront of the technology industry. Ever since, he has sought to protect and expand the lucrative business that counts spy agencies, government departments and some of the world’s largest corporations as clients.

2021-04-08T21:21:37.000Z,Should Shareholders Be Concerned About The Stock-Based Compensation And Insider Selling At Palantir (NYSE:PLTR)?,"When you see an insider selling their shares in a stock you own, it tends to raise eyebrows. Why would they sell if they truly believe in the company? Have they lost faith in the future? First impressions are concerning, but there can be legitimate reasons for selling other than a lack of optimism in the company’s future prospects. Maybe that individual wants to buy a house, maybe they are too exposed to the company and want to diversify a little or maybe they are simply liquidating the stocks they’ve received as part of their compensation. There could be any number of reasons as to why, and it’s a case by case basis. We often forget that these executives are investors too, and they need to manage their wealth and risk accordingly, no matter how bullish they are. However, when we see a company that has broad selling amongst multiple insiders and a stock-based compensation (SBC) structure that seems to favour management over shareholders, it can be a little bit more concerning. Palantir ( NYSE:PLTR ) is one such company. The company has gained the spotlight for its industry leading data analytics capabilities and its high profile customer base, but less focus has been on its compensation method or executives disposals of stock. It’s worth looking into the amount of selling and the SBC because over the long-term, it can impact shareholder returns. The company went public in September last year via a direct listing instead of an IPO, and because of that there were no new shares issued. Instead, existing shareholders were able to sell their stock and executives were allowed to sell up to one-fifth (20%) of their shareholding. Many executives took advantage of this and sold a combined $440m in the first 3 days of trading (this includes selling by some investment firms where executives are beneficial owners).

2021-04-07T21:45:09.000Z,Palantir Technologies Inc. (PLTR) Stock Sinks As Market Gains: What You Should Know,"Palantir Technologies Inc. (PLTR) closed the most recent trading day at $22.90, moving -1.59% from the previous trading session. This move lagged the S&P 500's daily gain of 0.15%. Prior to today's trading, shares of the company had gained 4.09% over the past month. This has outpaced the Business Services sector's gain of 0.58% and lagged the S&P 500's gain of 6.19% in that time. Wall Street will be looking for positivity from PLTR as it approaches its next earnings report date. PLTR's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $0.18 per share and revenue of $1.46 billion. These results would represent year-over-year changes of -5.26% and +33.58%, respectively. Investors might also notice recent changes to analyst estimates for PLTR. Recent revisions tend to reflect the latest near-term business trends. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability. Based on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. To benefit from this, we have developed the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system. Ranging from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), the Zacks Rank system has a proven, outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks returning an average of +25% annually since 1988. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate remained stagnant. PLTR is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold). Valuation is also important, so investors should note that PLTR has a Forward P/E ratio of 133.94 right now. For comparison, its industry has an average Forward P/E of 30.39, which means PLTR is trading at a premium to the group. The Technology Services industry is part of the Business Services sector. This industry currently has a Zacks Industry Rank of 170, which puts it in the bottom 34% of all 250+ industries.   "
2021-04-07T15:47:48.000Z,"Palantir Won Government Contract, But This Analyst Isn’t Happy","Palantir (PLTR) is a polarizing name on Wall Street, eliciting a wide array of views from the analyst community. Its latest contract win has done little to convince William Blair's Kamil Mielczarek, that a reassessment is in order. The big data specialist was recently awarded a $90 million 5-year contract for the Department of Energy's Safety Analytics, Forecasting & Evaluation Reporting (SAFER) program. Palantir’s platform will integrate data and enable the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) to assess the organization’s safety programs’ health. Additionally, Mielczarek anticipates the Department of Defense to shortly announce that Palantir “renewed and potentially upsized” its $300 million contract for the Special Operations Command (SOC) All Source Information Fusion (ASIF) program. Either way, the announcements might instigate a rally but won’t alter the stock’s long-term prospects, says the analyst. “While this SAFER contract award and the likely ASIF renewal are positive and will likely lead to short-term upside, we expect the downward trend to resume over the longer term on a confluence of factors,” Mielczarek said. “In our view, Palantir needs to significantly improve its commercial/enterprise performance and win more of these types of government contracts to justify its 34 times sales multiple.” The Department of Energy win could potentially add $18 million in incremental revenue per year, but Mielczarek says that, otherwise, the investment firm’s Dotted Line tracker shows that Palantir “had a fairly quiet first quarter for government bookings."" Besides an early January $8.5 million Army TITAN prototype award, there were no other government contract wins in the quarter. What’s more, while the program’s potential value might be around the $250 million mark, Raytheon and Northrop Grumman are developing prototypes for the Defense Innovations Unit program, as well. Palantir is also lagging its data analytics peers in its attempts to further build out the commercial division. Mielczarek says the company has so far failed to achieve the sort of hypergrowth that will justify the lofty multiples.     "
2021-04-06T14:27:49.000Z,Palantir Technologies Wins $89.9M Contract; Shares Gain,"Palantir Technologies has secured an $89.9 million contract from the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) for five years. Shares of the software company closed 1.6% higher on Monday. Notably, this marks the company’s first contract with the NNSA. Per the contract, Palantir Technologies (PLTR) will act as the platform for the NNSA’s SAFER (Safety Analytics, Forecasting, and Evaluation Reporting) project. SAFER is the proposed platform that will integrate data and allow the NNSA to measure the health of the organization’s safety programs. As a result, the NNSA staff will be able to track, trend, query, and analyze safety metrics from different sites across the country. Palantir’s USG President Akash Jain said, “Our work with NNSA illustrates Palantir’s mission to provide software to the world’s most important institutions in support of their most critical work.” Earlier, during the 4Q conference call, Palantir said that its average revenue per user has risen by 41% year-over-year to $7.9 million. Furthermore, its average revenue reached $33.2 million for its top 20 customers. (See Palantir Technologies stock analysis on TipRanks) Following the 4Q results, Morgan Stanley analyst Keith Weiss reiterated his Sell rating but increased the price target to $19 (18.9% downside potential) from $17. While Weiss remains upbeat on Palantir’s large addressable market, he sees challenges for the company in terms of reaching its revenue goal. Furthermore, Weiss finds Palantir’s current valuation unattractive. Turning to the rest of Wall Street, Palantir Technologies has a Moderate Sell consensus rating based on 4 Sells, 2 Buys, and 1 Hold. The average analyst price target is $25.83, which implies upside potential of 10.2% to current levels. However, from TipRanks’ Smart Score ranking, PLTR gets a 3 out of 10, suggesting that the stock is likely to underperform market expectations. Related News

These customers rely on Foundry to optimize operations and maintenance, forecast network health, and respond to unexpected events. At the first installment of Palantir’s Double Click series, engineers will demo the latest capabilities that make this work possible: Chained model simulations. Foundry harmonizes data models across all organizational domains, thereby establishing semantic links between IoT time series data and supporting metadata. This ontology can then be used to provide inputs to models which mirror an organization’s real-world operations, which in turn output into the ontology. To understand the full impact of any decision, these models can be chained together in a digital twin that can be used to adapt to events in real time, or run rigorous simulations for future events. By uniting model-building and operations in one platform, any insights and optimizations propagate through an organization’s daily decisions. Unmatched range of analytical computations. In order to overcome the usual trade-off between complex but slow queries and simple but fast queries on ontological and time series data, Foundry's query optimizer rewrites analytical queries in order to push down operators towards the data, both in ""hot"" and in ""cold"" storage. This means that queries execute with better performance and smaller resource footprint. Moreover, the optimizer is available to all queries, whether they were submitted through APIs, from models, or via graphical analysis applications in Foundry. This allows customers to interrogate up to many trillions of sensor readings in real time. Dynamic orchestration without tradeoffs. Foundry serves all IoT time series data that has been ingested into the platform. The data is readily available through end-user APIs and diverse tooling, without incurring the cost to store everything in high-performance storage. Traditional time series systems force a tradeoff between keeping data in optimized but expensive ""hot"" storage, and offloading archived data to cheaper ""cold"" storage where it can no longer be queried. Foundry’s ""hot"" / ""warm"" system removes the tradeoff by automatically hydrating archived data into hot storage on-demand. Using Foundry, customers have seen compression ratios as high as 50x on machine-generated data, depending on initial format. This allows industrial customers whose capital assets are equipped with thousands of sensors each — such as airplanes, oil wells, and manufacturing plants — to stream and ingest millions of new data points per second. In addition to these capabilities, Palantir will highlight two new Archetypes available on top of Foundry that make these capabilities available to industrial customers in a matter of clicks, including:           "
2021-04-05T19:00:08.000Z,"Why Tim Quast Likes CCIV, Eaton, Disney, Palantir Stock","The special purpose acquisition company Churchill Capital Corp IV (NYSE: CCIV) has caught the eye of Tim Quast, founder and CEO of Market Structure EDGE. The SPAC announced Feb. 22 that it's merging with Lucid Motors. ""[The] sentiment has bottomed, so I look at this purely from a market structure standpoint and say, 'wow, this is very interesting now,'"" Quast said Monday on Benzinga's PreMarket Prep show. ""If you want to make money in something, you leave when sentiment has topped and begins to slide. Then you return when sentiment rises."" Quast's Stock Ideas: The next stock on Quast's radar is Eaton Corp (NYSE: ETN). ""Sometimes you go where people aren't and you get your return there,"" he said, calling Eaton a ""great stock to trade."" When sentiment ""ticks back over five, which it just did, that tends to be a great time to own it,"" he said. PreMarket Prep co-host Dennis Dick said he loves buying stocks near the highs. ""If this thing can break out over that $142 [level], I think you are giving us some good ideas here this morning."" Quast named The Walt Disney Company (NYSE: DIS) as another stock with short volume that shot up right at options expiration. Short volume is now below the trend and sentiment is ticking up, he said. ""In terms of market structure, that looks appealing."" Producer Spencer Israel asked Quast for an update on Palantir Technologies Inc. (NYSE: PLTR). What is interesting about Palantir is ""how difficult it has been for this stock to recover,"" Quast said. ""At some point, money is coming back to this."" For reference, the average hold time for one of Quast's trades is five days.

2021-04-04T17:57:52.000Z,3 Bullish Tech Stocks For Technical Traders Going Into The Week,"The SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE: SPY) closed at an all-time high of $400.64 Friday following a seven-week-long tech rout. With the ramp-up to earnings season starting, the following three tech stocks could be headed for a bullish week. Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL) closed on strong daily support at $123. Apple stock is trading above the commonly followed 8- and 21-day exponential moving averages and looks to be completing the right shoulder in a bullish inverted head-and-shoulder pattern. If Apple can clear the white descending trendline, and break the neckline of the inverted head-and-shoulder pattern, it has room to rise to $127.28, which is the next level of resistance on the daily chart. Palantir Technology Inc (NYSE: PLTR) is trading in a bullish falling wedge pattern on the daily chart. Although it may need more time to complete the pattern, a break of the descending trendline and a push through daily resistance at $25.21 could see Palantir stock rise up to fill the gap between $30.44 and $31.34. Palantir stock is currently trading above the 8 EMA but below the 21 EMA. A break above the 21 EMA would also be bullish. Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) closed above daily resistance of $655.90 and above the descending trendline that had been holding it down since Feb. 8. Like Apple stock, Tesla stock is completing the right shoulder of a bullish inverted head-and-shoulder pattern. Traders would like to see Tesla stock break above the next daily resistance of $693.91, which could see the stock rise to its next daily resistance level of $718.16. With Tesla’s first-quarter delivery numbers out of the way now, traders can use the chart to predict price action with less risk.

This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210401005274/en/ Palantir’s customers in Life Sciences span pharmaceuticals, research institutions, healthcare systems, and others. These customers rely on Foundry’s secure and collaborative architecture to discover and develop drugs, manage commercial launches, conduct clinical research, and distribute vaccines. For example: More than 1,000 researchers at the NIH’s National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C) use Foundry to securely maintain one of the largest patient-level data assets of COVID-19 Electronic Health Record (EHR) data in the world and collaborate on more than 150 research projects (as illustrated in this video demonstration by N3C). Thousands of General Practitioners at NHS England order, allocate, track, and deliver every one of the 29+ million vaccines administered in the country to date (as outlined in the UK Government's website for data and insights on COVID-19). At the first installment of Palantir’s Double Click series, engineers will demo the latest Foundry capabilities, as well as several new Archetypes available on top of Foundry that make this work possible in a matter of clicks, including: Reproducible research in any environment. Foundry’s interoperable, modular, and open architecture enables users of varying technical ability to integrate any data, use any tool, manage any model, and write code in any language — while maintaining end-to-end reproducibility, transparency, and security of their analyses. Foundry integrates its governance and knowledge management capabilities with common data science environments such as RStudio or HPC clusters, enabling users to work reproducibly with any libraries of their choice — from specialized bioinformatics tools such as plink to machine learning libraries such as scikit-learn, tensorflow, or MLlib. Purpose-based access controls. Foundry’s Purpose-Based Access Controls Archetype enables automated or managed assignment of permissions based on the proposed use of a particular data source or dataset. By systematically encoding data access requests alongside the context of the associated research, these access controls provide governance administrators with granular insight into every analysis a piece of data is used for, by whom, and for what reason. Systematic model management. Foundry’s Model Management Archetype supports the governance and deployment of predictive models, including those developed outside Foundry. Researchers can readily reproduce results, track how each version of a model was developed, automatically update models when upstream source data changes, compare performance metrics, and tag versions for release into staging or production environments. Models can be deployed within Foundry (batch or streaming, or API endpoint for ad-hoc querying) or to external systems, including specialized hardware. Health checks, telemetry, and rich model monitoring of deployments help organizations go beyond model drift to understand and manage their models against real-world scenarios. Out of the box pipeline templates for standardized data models. Foundry’s Pipeline Archetype deploys pre-built data pipelines that convert common real-world data sources such as Optum claims or TriNetX into standard data models, such as OMOP. This enables researchers to easily pivot between sources, and reuse cohort code lists or analytic methods that have already been defined by the open-source community. For unique data sources, such as historic Randomized Controlled Trials, Foundry’s machine learning-powered Entity Resolution Archetype provides the framework for automatically suggesting mappings to a user-defined data model and enabling human-driven confirmation. For examples of research studies and publications powered by Palantir Foundry, please see the list below.                     "

CEO Karp expressed frustration in Wall Street’s short-term thinking, not investment generally. Palantir’s long-term investments in building the product to sustain its growth is the key takeaway from that CNBC interview. The hope is that the CEO’s warning will deter speculators while attracting the long-term investor. This will ultimately lower the volatility in Palantir shares.

Palantir Daily Chart Analysis: The daily chart above shows that the Palantir stock price is approaching key technical levels and looks to potentially be forming what technical traders call a “head and shoulders” pattern. The stock previously had resistance near $20 before breaking above, the stock then retested this area and found support near the $20 level. This is an area where the stock could bounce. The chart looks to be forming a head and shoulders pattern. The pattern is considered to be a bearish reversal pattern. Although the pattern is considered bearish, it may not always act in that manner. The pattern occurs when the stock runs up and makes a high, consolidates and goes on to make a new high, falls and bounces near support before rising toward the initial high and finally sells off below the initial support. See also: How to Buy Palantir Technologies (PLTR) Stock Bulls would like to see the stock bounce near the potential support level of $20 before crossing above the head and shoulders pattern and ending bearish sentiment in the stock. This could indicate the stock is making a reversal upward near support levels. Bears would like to see the stock fall through the $20 support and consolidate, retesting the price level as resistance, before the stock may make further downward moves.This would confirm the head and shoulders pattern that may be seen on the daily chart.

2021-03-25T14:51:48.000Z,Analyzing Palantir Technologies's Unusual Options Activity,"Shares of Palantir Technologies (NYSE:PLTR) saw some unusual options activity on Thursday. Following the unusual option alert, the stock price moved up to $22.09. Sentiment: BEARISH Option Type: SWEEP Trade Type: PUT Expiration Date: 2021-03-26 Strike Price: $25.00 Volume: 2540 Open Interest: 14464 Three Indications Of Unusual Options Activity Exceptionally large volume (compared to historical averages) is one reason for which options market activity can be considered unusual. The volume of options activity refers to the number of contracts traded over a given time period. The number of unsettled contracts that have been traded, but not yet closed, is called open interest. These contracts are not yet closed because a buyer has not purchased the contract, or a seller has not sold it. The trading of a contract with an expiration date in the distant future is another sign of unusual activity. Generally, additional time until a contract expires increases the potential for it to reach its strike price and grow its time value. Time value is important in this context because it represents the difference between the strike price and the value of the underlying asset. Contracts with a strike price far from the underlying price are also considered unusual because they are defined as being ""out of the money"". This occurs when the underlying price is under the strike price on a call option, or above the strike price on a put option. These trades are made because the underlying asset value is expected to change dramatically in the future, and the buyer or seller can take advantage of a greater profit margin. Bullish And Bearish Sentiments Options are ""bullish"" when a call is purchased at/near ask price or a put is sold at/near bid price. Options are ""bearish"" when a call is sold at/near bid price or a put is bought at/near ask price. These observations are made without knowing the investor's true intent by purchasing these options contracts. The activity is suggestive of these strategies, but an observer cannot be sure if a bettor is playing the contract outright or if the options bettor is hedging a large underlying position in common stock. For the latter case, bullish options activity may be less meaningful than the exposure a large investor has on their short position in common stock.        "

2021-03-22T13:46:34.000Z,Looking Into Palantir Technologies's Return On Capital Employed,"During Q4, Palantir Technologies (NYSE:PLTR) brought in sales totaling $322.09 million. However, earnings decreased 81.53%, resulting in a loss of $156.57 million. Palantir Technologies collected $289.37 million in revenue during Q3, but reported earnings showed a $847.78 million loss. Why ROCE Is Significant Return on Capital Employed is a measure of yearly pre-tax profit relative to capital employed by a business. Changes in earnings and sales indicate shifts in a company's ROCE. A higher ROCE is generally representative of successful growth of a company and is a sign of higher earnings per share in the future. A low or negative ROCE suggests the opposite. In Q4, Palantir Technologies posted an ROCE of -0.1%. Keep in mind, while ROCE is a good measure of a company's recent performance, it is not a highly reliable predictor of a company's earnings or sales in the near future. Return on Capital Employed is an important measurement of efficiency and a useful tool when comparing companies that operate in the same industry. A relatively high ROCE indicates a company may be generating profits that can be reinvested into more capital, leading to higher returns and growing EPS for shareholders. In Palantir Technologies's case, the ROCE ratio shows the amount of assets may not be helping the company achieve higher returns. Investors may take this into account before making any long-term financial decisions. Q4 Earnings Recap Palantir Technologies reported Q4 earnings per share at $0.06/share, which beat analyst predictions of $0.02/share.

Eastman Kodak Company (NYSE: KODK) shares were trading lower after the company reported 2020 earnings results during the after-hours session and filed for a mixed shelf offering of up to $500 millionm Palantir Technologies Inc (NYSE: PLTR) CEO Alex Karp joined CNBC Tuesday afternoon to discuss the global impact of big data analytics and his vantage point of how dangerous Wall Street can be. The Palantir boss believes Wall Street at-large places much emphasis on near-term gains at the expense of developing healthy, long-lasting companies. See also: Best Online Stock Brokers Karp went on to say the short-term focus of Wall Streeters is “one of the most destructive, corrosive attributes of an otherwise interesting and largely functioning system.” General Electric Company (NYSE: GE) unveiled Vscan Air, a cutting-edge, wireless pocket-sized ultrasound that provides crystal clear image quality, whole-body scanning capabilities, and intuitive software - all in the palm of clinicians' hands. GE Healthcare says Vscan Air increases access to precise care, helping improve workflow efficiencies and patient outcomes through dual-probe whole-body scanning capabilities and a user-friendly interface.

What Happened: Although both companies have been in business for years -- Palantir was founded in 2003, BlackBerry in 1984 — their proprietary technology has become increasingly sought after by numerous companies across many major sectors. The companies have a lot in common too. Each company's platforms have disrupted the technology space by changing the course of how other businesses operate. The companies they partner with plug their own technology into Palantir and BlackBerry’s platforms and together create systems that are not only user-friendly but also completely safe and secure, something both companies pride themselves on. Both companies also have a long history with the U.S. government. Through its wholly-owned subsidiary BlackBerry Government Solutions headquartered in Washington D.C., BlackBerry provides an end-to-end software stack that protects the data of nearly every federal department. More than 70% of all federal employees use devices that are protected by BlackBerry’s crisis communication solution. Similarly, Palantir, a company that has seemed shrouded in secrecy until this year, provides software used by the U.S. Intelligence Community and the Department of Defense for counterterrorism projects. Although never officially confirmed by the company, it is widely reported that Palantir’s data-mining software was used to locate Osama Bin Laden. Why It Matters: Recently more and more corporations, such as automakers, big tech companies and private organizations, have been jumping on board using BlackBerry and Palantir software. Both companies' software platforms can be used by a single company to assist in secure and safe data analytics, transfers and storage. The duo also holds partnerships with Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) cloud service platform Amazon Web Services (AWS).              "

2021-03-09T14:43:19.000Z,Understanding Palantir Technologies's Unusual Options Activity,"Shares of Palantir Technologies (NYSE:PLTR) saw some unusual options activity on Tuesday. Following the unusual option alert, the stock price moved down to $22.53. Sentiment: BULLISH Option Type: SWEEP Trade Type: PUT Expiration Date: 2021-03-12 Strike Price: $23.00 Volume: 1279 Open Interest: 12145 Three Signs Of Unusual Options Activity One way options market activity can be considered unusual is when volume is exceptionally higher than its historical average. The volume of options activity refers to the number of contracts traded over a given time period. Open interest is the number of unsettled contracts that have been traded but not yet closed by either counterparty. In other words, open interest represents the quantity of contracts that individual parties have written but not yet found a counterparty for (i.e. a buyer finding a seller, or a seller finding a buyer). Another sign of unusual activity is the trading of a contract with an expiration date in the distant future. Usually, additional time until a contract expires allows more opportunity for it to reach its strike price and grow its time value. Time value is important to consider because it represents the difference between the strike price and the value of the underlying asset. ""Out of the money"" contracts are unusual because they are purchased with a strike price far from the underlying asset price. ""Out of the money"" occurs when the underlying price is under the strike price on a call option, or above the strike price on a put option. Buyers and sellers try to take advantage of a large profit margin in these instances because they are expecting the value of the underlying asset to change dramatically in the future. Understanding Sentiment Options are ""bullish"" when a call is purchased at/near ask price or a put is sold at/near bid price. Options are ""bearish"" when a call is sold at/near bid price or a put is bought at/near ask price.        "

2021-03-08T13:50:01.000Z,Implied Volatility Surging for Palantir Technologies (PLTR) Stock Options,"Investors in Palantir Technologies Inc. PLTR need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Apr 16, 2021 $65.00 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today. Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy. Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Palantir Technologies shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Palantir Technologies is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the Technology Services industry that ranks in the Bottom 20% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, one analyst has increased the earnings estimates for the current quarter, while none have dropped their estimates. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from 2 cents per share to 4 cents in that period. Given the way analysts feel about Palantir Technologies right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected. Check out the simple yet high-powered approach that Zacks Executive VP Kevin Matras has used to close recent double and triple-digit winners.

GlaxoSmithKline plc (NYSE: GSK) has been a big disappointment, said Cramer. He really believed in the idea of splitting into high-growth and not-so-high growth segments, but he has been wrong.
