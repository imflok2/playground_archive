ALEXIS CHRISTOFOROUS: I want to continue our discussion on the markets now and bring in Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National. Art, good to see you. I want to stick with these meme stocks and the fact that a lot of investors might not even know they own these stocks because they're part of the Russell 2000 Small Cap Value Index. I'm talking about AMC and GameStop among them. What do regular investors who don't want to play the meme game need to know about what's going on in that space right now? ART HOGAN: Yeah, it's such a great question, Alexis. And I think that-- I think you and Jared hit it right in the last section, where he said it's its own animal. And you said it's a frenzy, right? So understand that that's what's going on right now. It's a separate sideshow. It is its own animal. It is a frenzy. It's a mania. But if you are along the Russell 2000, the IWM, part of the movement you've seen in the Russell 2000 has been because of companies like AMC and GameStop. And that will continue to be the case until they reconstitute that index. And actually, these names are going to get kicked out because they're too large. This is the function of if they're going to be put into the Russell 1,000, right? So that's what happens once a year, where it just so happens that that's happening this month. But in the near term, understand that if there's a handful of meme stocks that are rotating in and out of favor, it could have a potential move on the Russell 2000. But understand very small, the percentage that AMC or GameStop, back in the day when GameStop was the only game in town. In meme land, I think that that had a bit of a move on the Russell, too. But I think the Russell, too, really has been driven. Because it's domestically focused, focused on the US economy. Small cap tend to be cyclical. There's a lot of energy and financials in there. So I think there's a lot more fundamental drivers for the Russell 2000 right now versus that poll that has been the meme stock frenzy.

2021-06-08T14:36:15.000Z,Developing countries desperately need COVID vaccines: World Bank’s Ayhan KoseYahoo Finance Video,"Ayhan Kose, World Bank Prospects Group Director, joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss how COVID vaccine rollouts could impact developing countries and the global outlook for inflation. JULIE HYMAN: Let's get to the World Bank and its new prediction for what is going to happen in the global economy. 5.6% is the forecast for global growth this year. But as I mentioned, highly uneven is how the report characterizes it. Ayhan Kose is with us now. He's Director of the Prospects Group at the World Bank, as well as our Brian Cheung is joining us. Ayhan, as I look at this report, I have to wonder-- as we look at the unevenness of the recovery, as we look at the unevenness of vaccine distribution, for example, and how it's linked to economic recovery, how much is that 5.6% gain even at risk from the unevenness that we are going to see around the globe? AYHAN KOSE: Unevenness is the key word. And when you look at the global economy, the headline 5.6% is a record growth number. In fact, it is the fastest rate of growth after a global recession we have seen almost 80 years. Now, it is a tale of two recoveries. You have advanced economies. They are vaccinating rapidly and they are delivering phenomenal growth rates. Look at the US-- growth is going to be close to 7% this year, the fastest rate since the mid-'80s. China has done well in terms of vaccinating its population. It's going to grow 8.5%. And then you have other countries-- emerging market, developing economies other than China. Their growth rates are going to be around 4, 4.5%. Main reason is they are not vaccinating rapidly. They are still dealing with outbreaks. And of course, they provided much smaller amount of fiscal and monetary policy support measures. Going forward, it is going to be critical to vaccinate everywhere around the world, vaccinate everyone, and get the vaccination as quick as possible. BRIAN CHEUNG: Ayhan, it's Brian Cheung here. Great to speak with you. So given that point that there could be that kind of disparate recovery because of the access to vaccines, how should countries, beyond trying to improve vaccine distribution, which we heard David Malpass of the World Bank kind of talk about and advocate for at the G7 meeting, what beyond that should advanced nations like the United States, like the other G7 countries be doing to assist those low income countries that might have a slower recovery?

2021-06-07T13:33:13.000Z,Surging meme stocks like AMC and GameStop send Russell 2000 skyrocketing,"Meme stock mania has been mighty kind to the small-cap Russell 2000 Index after its reconstitution last June.  The total market capitalization of the Russell 2000 Index surged 84% from last year’s reconstitution (or the addition and subtraction of new companies to the index) to $3.5 trillion, FTSE Russell said in weekend tweet. This year alone, the Russell 2000 is up more than 16% compared to a 12% gain for the S&P 500. ""In 2020, overall capitalization for the U.S. equity market stayed fairly flat, decreasing by 1%. However, we’ve seen a surge in growth in the first half of 2021 with the total market cap in the Russell 1000 reaching $44.1 trillion. We have also seen a resurgence in market capitalizations of small cap companies in the Russell 2000 reflecting the overall bounce back of U.S. equity markets following the COVID-19 recession in early 2020,"" said FTSE Russell CEO Arne Staal. To be sure, the index has been powered by massive gains in popular stocks among a new army of retail trades such as AMC (AMC) and GameStop (GME).  AMC shares have gained more than 700% in one-year's time, giving the money-losing movie theater chain a whopping $25 billion market cap. As for struggling GameStop, its stock has exploded 4,900% over the past year — it now sports a lofty $17.6 billion market cap. Given each company's bulging market caps, they are likely to be removed from the Russell 1000. The index typically showcases companies with sub $5 billion market caps.  Currently, the smallest company in the Russell 2000 Index is Velocity Financial (VEL). It boasts a market cap of $257.1 million, an increase of 171.2% from $94.8 million in 2020.  FTSE Russell's changes to its various indexes will take place after U.S. stock markets close on June 25. The company points out the reconstitution will impact more than $10.6 trillion in investor assets benchmarked to, or invested in, products based on the Russell U.S. indexes.

2021-06-07T19:37:29.000Z,Meme Stock Bulls Take Back Control as Hedge Fund Battle RagesFX Empire,"After a wave of selling heading into the weekend, retail investors have wrestled back control of their favorite shorted stocks, including AMC Entertainment and GameStop. The stocks are off their highs of the day, and retail investors are convinced that something shady is going on. Short sellers are swinging back after losing USD 2.2 billion from AMC’s rally last week. There are theories of traders pulling out all the stops — including the illegal practice of naked shorting, which is currently trending on Twitter. Shares of AMC have galloped 16% today but still failed to cross the psychologically important USD 60 level, where the movie chain stock closed above on June 2 for the first time. While AMC might be off its peak, investors don’t have much to clamor about considering that the stock has skyrocketed more than 467% since early May. Fellow WallStreetBets stock GameStop is tacking on close to 11% in today’s session. The stock has gained more than 1,400% year-to-date for a market cap of USD 19.4 billion. GameStop investors have proven to be a loyal bunch as it hasn’t always been easy to hold. But those who have stuck around continue to be rewarded with more potential runway for gains. Ihor Dusaniwsky, managing director of predictive analytics at S3 Partners, revealed in a tweet that GMC and AMC each have a short squeeze risk score attached of 10 out of a possible 10. Meanwhile, the WallStreetBets crowd has taken over Twitter, with #nakedshorting trending on the social media site. To be clear, unlike regular shorting, which is legal, naked selling is not legal. It has to do with selling shares that have not been issued yet. Nonetheless, it still happens in the market. Naked shorting is how 140% of GameStop’s float can have short interest, as pointed out by Charles Payne on Fox Business. Christian, Smith & Jewell Law Firm Attorney Wes Christian said he blames the prime brokers that are custodying the assets as well as market makers for this behavior.

2021-06-08T17:31:25.000Z,GameStop stock sent higher by meme trading army ahead of earningsYahoo Finance,"The meme stock army is showing its support for the OG of the 2021 retail trading movement — GameStop (GME) — ahead of the company's earnings on Wednesday evening. Shares of GameStop rose as much as 6% to $292 in afternoon trading on Tuesday as fast-money traders positioned themselves prior to the earnings release. GameStop was among the top five most commented stocks on social media, according to data from social monitoring service HypeEquity. Talk on social media of call options on GameStop — or a bet on the stock rising in the short-term — outpaced chatter of put options by a five-to-one ratio.  HypeEquity data shows traders keen on pushing GameStop's stock above $300 before earnings hit the tape.  Over on SwaggyStocks, another social media tracking platform, GameStop's stock was the fourth most commented on ticker on Reddit's WallStreetBets page. Positive mentions on the stock outnumbered negative mentions by six times. It's clear meme traders continue to overlook the present fundamental state of GameStop (which is bad). Instead they appear to be staying true to large shareholder and soon-to-be chairman Ryan Cohen (aka Chewy co-founder) outlining some form of revitalization plan for the chain in 2021. Speaking to GameStop's fundamentals, here is what Wall Street expects from the retailer in the first quarter. Note that the Bloomberg compiled consensus estimates only reflect projections from three analysts. Most sell-side analysts have dropped coverage of GameStop given the heightened volatility of its stock during the meme army's uprising.  Net Sales: $1.17 billion, up 14.6% from a year ago Adjusted Operating Profits: loss of $67 million vs. a loss of $98.8 million a year ago Adjusted Diluted EPS: loss of 71 cents vs. loss of $1.61 a year ago One of those analysts that recently pulled coverage on GameStop owing to insane levels of volatility is Bank of America's Curtis Nagle.

But when you pick a company that is really flourishing, you can make more than 100%. For example, the Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. (NASDAQ:BBBY) share price has soared 240% in the last year.

In the last year Bed Bath & Beyond saw its revenue shrink by 17%. We're a little surprised to see the share price pop 240% in the last year. This is a good example of how buyers can push up prices even before the fundamental metrics show much growth. It's quite likely the revenue fall was already priced in, anyway.

2021-06-04T17:28:45.000Z,This meme stock exploded 62% in one day and this Wall Street analyst has had enough,"Hat tip to you, Bank of America analyst Curtis Nagle for adhering to some very basic principles of investing, which still matter even though meme stock traders couldn't care less about valuation methodologies, free cash flow outlooks or margin structures.  After seeing Bed Bath & Beyond (BBY) shares explode 62% on June 2, Nagle said in a research note on Friday that it's time for him step back from the volatile stock.  ""This [move in the stock] comes in the context of no significant updates from Bed Bath & Beyond or any other material news. Bed Bath & Beyond did release a press release on 6/2/21 regarding the launch of three new private label brands but this was already expected by investors and is not material, in our view. Instead we believe that the rapid appreciation in Bed Bath & Beyond's shares is being driven by another surge in interest and trading led by retail investors,"" Nagle said. ""This follows a very large but short-term move in late January of this year. We also note that Bed Bath & Beyond's share price increase corresponds to big moves over the past week with ""meme stocks"" such as GameStop, AMC and BlackBerry. As a result, we move to No Rating as we believe shares of Bed Bath & Beyond are no longer trading on fundamentals. Investors should no longer rely upon our previous investment opinion or price objective.""  Nagle isn't the first sell-side analyst this year to remove a rating or price target — or just outright drop coverage — of a company swept up into meme stock mania. Even still, as this former analyst could attest these are drastic actions that are far from the norm among the analyst community on Wall Street. It's a group that prides itself on making great calls after conducting granular research and maintaining good relationships with executive teams.   But the surprise maneuvers do underscore how impossible it is for an analyst to properly cover a company — which includes talking with management, modeling out future earnings and communicating those things to clients —amid an environment fast-filling up with a new generation of retail traders. In this topsy turvy backdrop, a veteran analyst could go from being a hero one day to being out of a job tomorrow simply because a CEO like Adam Aron of AMC conducts an interview with a YouTube influencer.

2021-06-08T10:36:25.000Z,Clover Health soars as 'meme stock' rally expandsReuters,"(Reuters) -Shares of Clover Health Investments Corp surged as much as 109% on Tuesday as it became a new focus for small individual traders on social media platforms who have prompted rallies in heavily shorted U.S. stocks this year. Medicare-backed insurance seller Clover was among the most shorted stocks across U.S. exchanges, with Clover being the target of a report by short seller Hindenburg in February, which took a position in the company. ""The WallStreetBets forum (on Reddit) has identified (stocks with) over 30% short interests,"" said Thomas Hayes, managing member at Great Hill Capital Llc in New York. The ""meme stock"" phenomenon, which began with video game retailer GameStop Corp in January and spread to cinema operator AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc in May, has prompted the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to say it was looking into signs of market manipulation. Short interest in Clover Health is at 49.10 million shares, or 43.5% of the float, Ihor Dusaniwsky, managing director of predictive analytics at S3 said on Tuesday. Short sellers were down $465 million in mark-to-market losses on Tuesday, based on a more than 80% price gain, which raised year-to-date losses to $517 million, he said. Shorts have been building their position in Clover Health as its stock price has been rallying, Dusaniwsky said. Clover's backer, venture capitalist Chamath Palihapitiya, took the company public through a $3.7 billion reverse merger with his blank check firm in October 2020. Clover's shares were up 81.6% at $21.64 after earlier hitting a record high of $24.93. The company's options have drawn a surge of bullish action in recent days with trading volume surging to 587,000 contracts on Monday, compared with an average daily volume of under 50,000 contracts for the month of May, Trade Alert data showed. Call options speculating on the stock climbing all the way to $30 were among some of the most heavily traded contracts in recent days.

The sharp gains, however, have caught the attention of regulators at the Securities and Exchange Commission. On Monday the agency said it is looking into signs of market manipulation given the ""volatility in certain stocks.""

It's nice to see that Bed Bath & Beyond shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 240% over the last year. That certainly beats the loss of about 3% per year over the last half decade. This makes us a little wary, but the business might have turned around its fortunes. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Like risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted 2 warning signs for Bed Bath & Beyond (of which 1 is potentially serious!) you should know about.

Stocks recently featured in the blog include: AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. AMC, Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. BBBY, GameStop Corp. GME, GrowGeneration Corp. GRWG and Micron Technology, Inc. MU. AMC Entertainment shares soared nearly 100% Wednesday, while fellow so-called meme stocks Bed Bath & Beyond and GameStop jumped 60% and 13%, respectively. Despite these huge gains the broader market was far more subdued with all three major U.S. indexes up marginally on the day. The big meme moves occurred on another low volume day following the long Memorial Day weekend. The trading volume will likely remain far below average as summer begins and people start vacationing again. More cities around the U.S. are starting to reopen nearly completely amid the successful coronavirus vaccine push. The economic boom, coupled with the Fed's easy money policies, supply chain setbacks, government checks, and other factors have all contributed to rising prices that brought out inflation fears after April's 4.2% CPI figure was released. Clearly, rising prices must be monitored and Wall Street will be watching the Fed closely. But the central bank has continued to remain firm that inflation will be ""transitory."" Investors should also know that even if the Fed is forced to raise rates, yields will likely remain historically low, extending there is no alternative investing. For example, the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield has moved slightly above 3% only a few times in the last decade, after remaining well above the threshold in the pre-financial crisis world—it has hovered around 1.6% for much of the past three months.

The sharp gains, however, have caught the attention of regulators at the Securities and Exchange Commission. On Monday the agency said it is looking into signs of market manipulation given the ""volatility in certain stocks.""    The volatility has also made it challenging for analysts to cover, with two analysts in the past week dropping coverage of GameStop, the stock that was catapulted higher in January by retail investors.    Cinema operator AMC Entertainment Holdings, which almost doubled in value again last week, was last up 21.1% at $58.00 while BlackBlerry's U.S. listing climbed 15.0% to $15.94 and put it up 56% since the start of June.

The moves came a day after many growth stocks jumped and shares of so-called meme stocks such as AMC Entertainment AMC and Bed Bath & Beyond BBBY soared. Amid the return of meme stock mania, investors might want to consider buying highly-ranked “cheap” stocks that boast solid fundamentals. Adding to a portfolio even amid lower summer trading volume and inflation worries might prove beneficial given the broader bullish backdrop that includes the improving earnings picture and the U.S. economic boom, boosted by the reopening. And let’s remember that the bulls have pushed the S&P 500 back within touching distance of its highs as interest rates are likely to remain historically low even if the Fed is forced to raise rates to tamp down rising prices.

The firm is on an impressive run and the continued momentum in the housing market could help GRBK extend its growth streak. Home sales soared last year to their highest level since 2006 as people clamored for more space and took advantage of low mortgage rates, all driven by the coronavirus. The rampant demand has cooled down a bit amid tight supply that will likely benefit homebuilders. The Texas-based company topped our first quarter FY21 estimates in early May, with revenue up 10% against 27% top-line growth in the year-ago quarter. GRBK posted its best first quarter in company history and saw its net new home orders soar 71%. More importantly, it ended the quarter with its highest backlog in history, up 133%. “To meet the unprecedented demand, Green Brick started a record 2,043 homes in the last six months and ended the quarter with 2,303 units under construction, a 62% increase from a year ago,” CEO Jim Brickman said in prepared remarks.

Bed Bath & Beyond shares fell 28%, the steepest selloff since January, after notching a record advance Wednesday. Koss slid 24% in the biggest drop in four months. Other so-called meme stocks including GameStop Corp. and PetMed Express Inc. also declined Thursday. This comes as some retail investor favorites announced plans to sell shares. AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. shares sank after the movie theater operator said it was planning a stock offering, then they briefly turned positive in the afternoon after the cinema chain announced the sale raised $587 million. AMC closed down 18% in the biggest slide since early February. Elsewhere, Express Inc. dropped 20% after announcing a potential share sale of its own. PetMed Express, Bed Bath & Beyond, Express and AMC were the worst performers on the Russell 2000 Index Thursday. Another sign of cracks in the meme stock rally is the whipsaw in BlackBerry Ltd.

2021-06-08T10:36:25.000Z,Clover Health soars as 'meme stock' rally expandsReuters,"(Reuters) -Shares of Clover Health Investments Corp surged as much as 109% on Tuesday as it became a new focus for small individual traders on social media platforms who have prompted rallies in heavily shorted U.S. stocks this year. Medicare-backed insurance seller Clover was among the most shorted stocks across U.S. exchanges, with Clover being the target of a report by short seller Hindenburg in February, which took a position in the company. ""The WallStreetBets forum (on Reddit) has identified (stocks with) over 30% short interests,"" said Thomas Hayes, managing member at Great Hill Capital Llc in New York. The ""meme stock"" phenomenon, which began with video game retailer GameStop Corp in January and spread to cinema operator AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc in May, has prompted the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to say it was looking into signs of market manipulation. Short interest in Clover Health is at 49.10 million shares, or 43.5% of the float, Ihor Dusaniwsky, managing director of predictive analytics at S3 said on Tuesday. Short sellers were down $465 million in mark-to-market losses on Tuesday, based on a more than 80% price gain, which raised year-to-date losses to $517 million, he said. Shorts have been building their position in Clover Health as its stock price has been rallying, Dusaniwsky said. Clover's backer, venture capitalist Chamath Palihapitiya, took the company public through a $3.7 billion reverse merger with his blank check firm in October 2020. Clover's shares were up 81.6% at $21.64 after earlier hitting a record high of $24.93. The company's options have drawn a surge of bullish action in recent days with trading volume surging to 587,000 contracts on Monday, compared with an average daily volume of under 50,000 contracts for the month of May, Trade Alert data showed. Call options speculating on the stock climbing all the way to $30 were among some of the most heavily traded contracts in recent days.

The Dow closed well within negative territory, while the Nasdaq advanced. Still, the S&P and the Dow remained inside one percentage point of their record closing highs. ""Thematically, we're done with earnings, so you have this lull in between earnings when what drives the market is economic data points,"" said Joseph Sroka, chief investment officer at NovaPoint in Atlanta. ""There's not a lot of impetus for investors to take action today."" ""There's been this flip-flop between whether inflation will be transitory or persistent, and the next card that gets flipped over for that is the CPI report on Thursday,"" Sroka added. Smallcaps outperformed as the ongoing retail frenzy boosted stocks whose recent explosive trading volumes have been attributed to social media buzz. AMC Entertainment Holdings jumped 14.8%, extending the previous week's 85% gain. Other so-called ""meme stocks,"" including GameStop Corp and U.S.-listed shares of Blackberry Ltd advanced between 7% and 14%. ""You've seen a decades-long, technology-enabled democratization of the market and there's certainly groups of individual investors that flock to these ideas,"" Sroka said. ""We're seeing speculative trading in an age of multiple outlets and social media amplifies the news."" The Group of Seven (G7) advanced economies agreed on Saturday to back a minimum global corporate tax rate of at least 15%, a move Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen called a ""significant, unprecedented commitment"" to bring what she called a race to the bottom on global taxation.

While shares of AMC Entertainment (AMC) are having a volatile Thursday, the social-media-fueled trading frenzy has pushed shares of AMC up nearly 3,000% this year, giving the money-losing movie theater chain a market value of more than $30 billion. AMC is not alone. Shares of Bed, Bath & Beyond (BBBY), Express (EXPR), and BlackBerry (BB) are all up this year. It’s reminiscent of the eye-popping run-up in shares of Gamestop (GME) that we saw back in January, when the Reddit investing crowd bought shares of the struggling video game retailer to stick it to the Wall Street pros who were betting against the stock. Ryan Nauman, market strategist at Zephyr told Yahoo Finance Live that wild trading in these so-called meme stocks is not so much a “threat” to the broader market as it is a “learning experience.” “This is no longer our grandparents’, or for that matter, our parents' stock market,” Nauman said. “Now, investment professionals need to start focusing more on looking at alternative data sets, rethinking their investment thesis to consider this growing cohort of retail investors.” Even if you’ve vowed to stay away from the “meme trading madness,” you may own AMC and GameStop and not even know it, because the stocks are still part of the Vanguard Russell 2000 Value Index Fund ETF Shares (VTWV). The recent rallies in those two stocks have pushed the Russell 2000 Value Index up 30% year-to-date, dusting the Vanguard Russell 2000 Growth Index Fund ETF Shares' (VTWG) 3.8% gain during the same period. “These retail investors, because of day trading, and for the most part, because of this virtually free money that we've had from the Fed since the pandemic, their voice is getting much larger due to social media,” Nauman said. “They need to be considered when we are coming up with the investment thesis moving forward.”         ",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/this-is-no-longer-our-grandparents-or-parents-stock-market-strategist-175704670.html

Taking a look at the sector action here, worst performer is materials. The XLB off just over 1%. We're also seeing some under-performers in financials and industrials. Flipping over though to what's outperforming, why we aren't seeing broader losses here today, real estate is the biggest outperformer today, with that sector up just around 1%.

But one Wall Street strategist is warning investors that the ""hot vax summer"" for stocks ""might feel a little cold and rocky."" Callie Cox, senior investment strategist at Ally Invest, explained on Yahoo Finance Live that the summer is a historically weak period for stocks. Volume typically trails off as investors leave the office and hit the roads.  ""[W]e could see lower volume in the stock market. And lower volume typically leads to a wandering market, especially with the environment we're in, where investors are kind of looking around the corner and saying, 'what's next? What's the ominous thing on the outlook?' And they're feeling a little more hesitant about putting their money in stocks,"" she said. This doesn't preclude market strength or necessarily mean we'll see weakness this summer. Cox pointed out that since 1990, the S&P 500 has risen an average of 0.9% between Memorial Day and Labor Day. But that compares to an average of 3.6% for the months before Memorial Day and 4.2% for the months after Labor Day. ""Stocks have bucked the trend recently, though, with five straight summers of gains (including the S&P 500’s 16% gains last summer). And the market’s path of least resistance is higher,"" she said.  Earlier this year, Cox told Yahoo Finance that year two of a new bull market typically sees more muted returns than those of the first year, which tend to be higher. Despite the general market strength, investors should still exercise caution. In a separate statement to Yahoo Finance, she writes, ""In a (relatively) low-volume environment, bad news tends to hit a hit harder, and small shifts in buying or selling could lead to noticeable market swings. Investors are extra skittish these days, too. We can tell the market’s mindset has changed from 'What could go right?' to 'What could go wrong?,' and that’s led to quick selling on surprise headlines.""

2021-06-08T05:35:16.000Z,Meme Stocks Set To Extend Gains TuesdayInvesting.com,"By Dhirendra Tripathi Investing.com — Meme stocks, led by AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC), looked set to extend their gains for the second consecutive session rising 2%-5% in premarket Tuesday. The favorite of the Reddit gang, AMC, was up more than 4% while GameStop (NYSE:GME) and BlackBerry (NYSE:BB) gained approximately 2% and 3%, respectively. Meme stocks have defied the naysayers consistently over the last six months and while GameStop and Blackberry (TSX:BB) may be significantly off their year’s highs, it’s not been a flash in the pan. In the process, the stocks have made new highs several times and created wealth for many even as their books may not yet deserve those valuations. The companies are trying though. To the surprise of many, AMC has raised $1.24 billion in equity in three installments in less than a month, each at a different price, and proposes to sell 25 million more shares in 2022. GameStop, once a bankruptcy candidate, has reshuffled its top management as it tries to become a multichannel global retailer, retired part of its debt and created new facilities. Blackberry continues to strengthen its security software portfolio, have more cloud-based offerings and forge new partnerships.

So I haven't been surprised to see Tritton run that same operational playbook since arriving as Bed Bath & Beyond's CEO (his first CEO job) in late 2019 to essentially save the home goods retailer from ruin.  Tritton quickly canned most of the terrible, long-tenured, under performing management team. He wasted no time to sell off non-core assets to raise a boatload of cash to fund a turnaround. He laid out long-term financial targets to Wall Street, and is delivering on them in a very volatile retail backdrop. Meanwhile, he is aggressively remodeling stores and totally overhauling the merchandise in them in a bid to regain customer loyalty.  Over time, Bed Bath & Beyond shareholders will likely be rewarded for these careful, well thought out efforts. Up to this point they have been: Bed Bath's stock has surged 155% since Tritton was named CEO on October 9, 2019. Worth noting, shares of Tritton's former employer Target are up 104% over that timespan.  Having said all of that, it's really no surprise I found Tritton keeping things in perspective at about 12:30 p.m. on June 2, 2021 in an interview on Yahoo Finance Live. Tritton stepped to the mic (remotely, still) as his stock price was up more than 40%, swept up once again into the meme stock mania being churned up by an army of retail traders.  ""I think today's activities are just a day in time. It doesn't affect us operationally. We are focused and ready,"" Tritton said. ""Regardless of the stock movement our role is to create sequential growth and strength at both the balance sheet and in growth ratios. We believe we have been doing that.""

2021-06-07T17:40:28.000Z,A meme stock’s downward spiral: GameStop’s 14-year Fortune 500 run comes to an endFortune,"Meme stocks are making your 401(k) returns look minuscule. Since the start of 2021, the S&P 500 index has climbed 12.6%—which, if the year ended now, would be an above-average annual return. But that pales in comparison to shares of [hotlink]GameStop[/hotlink] (ticker: GME)—the alpha dog in the meme stock space—which are up a staggering 1,218% during that same span. When members of the r/WallStreetBets subreddit started buying GME and other meme stocks, including companies like BlackBerry (+109%) and AMC (+2,160%), in January, it looked like a classic pump and dump. Or a joke, in their eyes, meant to damage some hedge funds (read: Melvin Capital) while retail investors made a quick buck. For these three stocks, in particular, the dump hasn’t come. But that doesn’t rule out a pullback. Indeed, the prices of many of these meme stocks are completely out of whack with fundamentals. Just how detached are meme stocks from reality? There’s no better example than GameStop. When the 2021 edition of the Fortune 500, a ranking of the 500 largest U.S. publicly traded companies by revenue, was published last week, it did not have GameStop on it. That marked the end of GameStop’s 14-year streak on the list—including a No. 464 placement last year. Falling off the Fortune 500 list is just one of many signs that GameStop’s business model is floundering. Back in the aughts, GameStop stores in shopping malls and strip malls were packed with teenagers looking to buy and trade in games for their Xboxes and GameCubes. But in the early 2010s, that brick-and-mortar model was disrupted by the digitization of the video game industry, as more gamers began downloading new titles rather than buying physical copies. GameStop’s revenue, which peaked at $9.6 billion in 2012, had fallen to $6.5 billion by fiscal year 2020. Then the pandemic took it down another notch. During its 2021 fiscal year, which ran through Jan. 31, GameStop sales totaled $5.1 billion. Since 2012, its sales are down 47%.

2021-06-07T14:31:20.000Z,SEC Says It’s Scrutinizing Market Swings as Meme Stocks SurgeBloomberg,"(Bloomberg) -- The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said it’s scrutinizing markets for signs of manipulation and other misconduct as AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. and other meme stocks continue to surge. “SEC staff continues to monitor the market in light of the ongoing volatility in certain stocks to determine if there have been any disruptions of the market, manipulative trading or other misconduct,” the agency said in a Monday emailed statement. “In addition, we will act to protect retail investors if violations of federal securities laws are found.” AMC resumed its upward trajectory Monday, halting two straight days of declines. The stock -- like GameStop Corp. before it -- has become a darling of retail traders. The movie-theater chain’s wild rise comes despite questionable fundamentals, prompting concerns among regulators that investors could be sitting on substantial losses if the stock plunges. The SEC has already said it’s investigating what happened with GameStop in January, with a focus on whether traders were using online message boards to dupe other investors into buying into the rally.

2021-06-03T15:28:57.000Z,AMC embracing retail investors is 'rational': Strategist,"Interactive Brokers Chief Strategist Steve Sosnick joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss the latest outlook for meme stocks as AMC files to sell 11 million shares. - Let's bring in our first guest for the hour. We've got Steve Sosnick, Interactive Broker's chief strategist. Steve, I know you've been following this one really closely. There seems to be two camps here. You know, on the one hand you've got a company like AMC sort of acknowledging the wild swings they've seen in their stock, but addressing the retail traders through their program to try and keep the communication going. And then the others who say, this is just simply too risky because the fundamentals do not bear out the price it's trading at right now. How do you see the action? STEVE SOSNICK: Well, Akiko, that's a tricky, complex question. I think at some level you have both. I mean, I wrote a piece yesterday basically saying that it was clear that AMC was embracing the meme, and that it was thoroughly rational for them to do so. Because here you have a company that has billions of dollars in indebtedness. They-- you know, they suffered a huge hit during COVID, which we all understand, but prior to COVID they weren't making much money either. They had-- you know, they were more or less around flat line of earnings. They'd make money some quarters, give back money some others. The same with their cash flows. It's not a company that investors really would cater to in terms of that steady sort of income and cash flow growth that you would expect or want. So what can you do to get out of the situation you're in, with debt that's still trading, you know-- you know, basically with interest rates of 8% to 12%. The bond market's telling you, this is not a great company. And bond traders don't get caught up in hype the same way. They really only care about getting paid back, not about, you know, wild upside and volatility. And so I think that AMC said, we're going to embrace this. Bed Bath and Beyond, he's got a different point of view. But like it or not, all the meme stocks are sort of wrapped up in this weird thematic trade, you know, them and cryptos. And I think you see rotation.                 ",https://finance.yahoo.com/video/amc-embracing-retail-investors-rational-152857322.html

MYLES UDLAND: All right, welcome back to Yahoo Finance Live. Just about three minutes away from the opening bell on this Tuesday morning as we get set to wrap up the second quarter here, taking stock of where the global economy has come in the last year and where it might go for the balance of 2021. Joining us now to discuss is Jeffrey Kleintop. He's the Chief Global Investment Strategist over at Charles Schwab. So Jeff, you guys are out with your mid-year outlook. And I'm just curious how you guys are characterizing kind of this phase, this moment in the cycle. JEFFREY KLEINTOP: It's been an amazing economic recovery. I mean, we're all aware of it. But we may not be aware of the strength. I mean, to have an entire recession-- a deep one-- and a recovery all contained within five quarters has never happened before. And if the IMF is right and we get our 6% growth globally here in 2021, it's the fastest pace of growth since 1973. That kind of economic momentum has really led cyclicals to outperform this year. We think that continues in the second half. It's also caused a leadership shift from the US to Europe, where the more economically sensitive companies lie. We've seen Europe outperform so far this year. I think that's something that may also continue in part two of this year. BRIAN SOZZI: Jeff, it doesn't sound like you're too concerned about inflation. JEFFREY KLEINTOP: Well, certainly, inflation is a bigger risk than it's been in a long time. And inflation is likely to run higher in this cycle than it did in the last one. But already, we're starting to see signs that the momentum to inflation is starting to fade. Commodity prices have come down over the course of the last month, thanks in part to China really putting on the brakes. We've also seen supply chains get a little bit better. I like to watch port traffic. And if you take a look at the Port of Los Angeles, the biggest and most congested port in the world, we've gone from 40 ships waiting to unload their 40-foot unit-- 40-foot container ship units back in first quarter to about 30 ships waiting about a month ago to, I think I counted about 20 ships this morning. So that's, you know, things are getting unloaded, getting to their destinations, reducing the shortages that put at risk production or jobs tied to those supply chain disruptions. So I think we're getting a little bit better incrementally on the inflation front. And worries about a premature tightening, I think, are fading away.

According to figures from British trading company Freetrade, buy orders for AMC are up almost 300% on the week, and it is the most traded stock on the platform. Meanwhile, more than 63% of all new trades executed by UK traders on Capital.com in the past two weeks have been in financial derivatives linked to shares in AMC.  This is a significant jump from just 23% last month. Capital added that more than 82% of UK clients this week took a long position in the so-called meme stock. AMC was also the most purchased share on Hargreaves Lansdown, the biggest retail investment platform in the UK, over the past week with GameStop (GME) following closely behind.  It comes as AMC warned investors on Thursday not to ""buy our stock right now"", sending the price down as much as 30% before it pared back some losses. In a filing it said: ""We believe that the recent volatility and our current market prices reflect market and trading dynamics unrelated to our underlying business, or macro or industry fundamentals, and we do not know how long these dynamics will last. ""Under the circumstances, we caution you against investing in our Class A common stock, unless you are prepared to incur the risk of losing all or a substantial portion of your investment."" On Wednesday the cinema chain closed 95% higher on the day at $62.55 (£44.32), bringing its year-to-date gains to more than 3,000%. As of Wednesday’s close AMC had a market cap of $28bn, surpassing that of Delta Air Lines (DAL) and GameStop, the latter of which also joined the rally. Shares of Bed, Bath and Beyond (BBBY), Express (EXPR) and Koss (KOSS), which are all heavily shorted by Wall Street’s elite, were also caught up in the retail frenzy, all of which saw their share price rise more than 30% during the session.

The sharp gains prompted the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to say it was looking into signs of market manipulation given the ""volatility in certain stocks."" The volatility has challenged analysts, and two of them in the past week have stopped covering video game retailer GameStop, whose shares soared in January in a retail-driven rally. Cinema operator AMC jumped almost 15%, putting its gain over the past five sessions at 111%. BlackBerry's U.S. listing surged 14% and is now up 57% since the start of June. ""AMC never ceases to amaze me. Just when I think that train is over, it jumps almost 10 points in the first 30 min of trading,"" one poster on Reddit wrote. AMC shares are up about 2,500% in 2021 as the company has courted individual investors, while GameStop has surged over 1,300% year to date. Some bearish investors retreated from bets against AMC on Friday. Short interest slumped to 74.5 million shares, or 14.9% of AMC's float, from 88.2 million on Thursday, according to S3 Partners. Clover Health Investments, which has been the target of short sellers, was one of the most mentioned stocks on Reddit's wallstreetbets on Monday, with some users suggesting the shares as the forum's next short-squeeze target. The insurer's shares soared 32% in their highest volume trading day since April 19. Institutional investors are largely sitting on the sidelines as the meme-stock rally continues. Amateur investors, however, ""don't need a reason,"" said Michael O'Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading in Stamford, Connecticut. ""They're trying to do the same thing they did last week.

MYLES UDLAND: But let's begin our coverage this morning of the market with the story that remains the story. See it there? I love that animation. Meme madness in the market here. AMC, GameStop, of course really the two leading-- we'll call them the leading members of this act, this play, leading cast members of this performance we see happening in the market. But this morning, really, the chaos continues to spread. Wendy's the latest name to get involved. There's now a fast food angle to the stay-at-home trade. If we go all the way back in time to February of 2020, when Wallstreetbets first really became a driving force of conversation around the stock market-- so this was just on the eve of when the market's concern turned to full COVID all the time. We had a big ""Bloomberg Businessweek"" story about getting tendies and about buying call options. YOLO call options really were birthed with that story. Luke Kawa over at Bloomberg writing that. Luke, unfortunately, has since moved on to the dark side, asset management. But we have seen with Wendy's this morning, guys, literal tendies. Their nuggets are excellent, the spicy nuggets, of course. Don't get the regular ones. That's all in the market. And at this point, I mean, where do we begin? Sozzi, let's start with you because you actually cover Wendy's as a fundamental story. Do you have any updates for us there? Anything that we can point to on this? Or is it just the latest ticker to get Redditized here in this market? BRIAN SOZZI: Well, first off, yes, that is in fact correct. Wendy's got, what they say, touted on the Reddit stream early this morning. Also had my former boss Jim Cramer out there, doing his thing, touting Wendy's as well. But I hate to be the bearer of bad news here. But to the meme traders, there's actually a fundamental story to Wendy's. And they're coming off a pretty good first quarter a couple of weeks ago. I talked to CEO Todd Penegor. He tells me they are looking to go from 8,000 restaurants by 2025 from about 7,000 now, a billion-dollar-plus breakfast business probably over the next year.

BBBY skyrockets 62.1% on Jun 2 as it furthers its transformation plan, unveiling the launch of three more Owned Brands this quarter, just ahead of the Back-to-College shopping season. The launch forms part of the company’s key assortment expansion plan, with the objective of rebuilding its position in the $180-billion home market.

The product lines to be launched include Our Table, Wild Sage and Squared Away. The Our Table line will include modern cookware, bakeware, food prep, kitchen gadgets & utensils, kitchen linens, dining & barware products. The product line will comprise more than 1,100 products. Wild Sage is a youthful, eclectic collection of about 600 stylish housewares for the bedroom, bathroom, dining room and living space. Squared Away mainly includes storage, organization and cleaning solutions for the home. It offers nearly 300 storage items for the kitchen, closet, bathroom and organization throughout the home.

The latest product introductions will bring the company’s Owned Brands launches so far this year to six. Notably, it launched the Simply Essential, Haven and Nestwell Owned Brands last quarter. Simply Essential assortment line has been thoughtfully designed for meeting needs across every room of a house. It is the company's first full-line assortment at opening price points. Nestwell is an assortment line, including quality bed and bath goods. The Haven is a bath brand, which offers spa-inspired organic cotton products and more.

The launches indicate that the company is well ahead of its target of introducing at least eight Owned Brands by the end of February 2022. Moreover, the company earlier revealed plans to launch at least 10 Owned Brands in the next two years as part of its three-year transformation strategy.

Its transformation plan focuses on removing product redundancies and unproductive stock keeping units, store remodels and store closures. The company expects the Owned Brands to cater to the consumer needs across segments such as bed, bath, kitchen and dining, storage and organization, and home decor. It remains focused on launching several private-label brands, which are likely to contribute more than 60% to its revenues.

Moreover, management expects the sales penetration of Owned Brands to grow from 10% to 30% in the first three years. Further, the company expects to boost the gross margin by managing costs and sourcing. Another major step in its comprehensive growth strategy includes plans to launch thousands of products, exclusively available only at Bed Bath & Beyond.

The company is also on track with its three-year store optimization efforts. Management remains on track to close roughly 200 underperforming Bed Bath & Beyond stores by the end of fiscal 2021. As part of the program, it earlier expected nearly 15-20% of the sales lost from the stores to be transitioned to digital platforms. Also, it is progressing well with the store remodeling program, wherein proof-of-concept stores will showcase destination categories, bed, bath, kitchen, and storage products. The three-year plan will be executed on more than 450 stores, accounting for nearly 60% of its sales.

Further, the company intends to invest roughly $250 million to remodel nearly 450 stores over the next three years. Also, 130-150 stores are likely to be remodeled in fiscal 2021, with 26 stores in the fiscal first quarter.

Bed Bath & Beyond is focused on boosting consumers’ shopping experience by offering a wide range of home-related merchandise. Its moves to expand the Owned Brands assortment are likely to create substantial opportunities for long-term growth. This along with its store optimization efforts as well as digital and omni-channel expansion positions the company for growth in the future.

But when you pick a company that is really flourishing, you can make more than 100%. For example, the Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. (NASDAQ:BBBY) share price has soared 240% in the last year. Most would be very happy with that, especially in just one year! It's also up 25% in about a month. And shareholders have also done well over the long term, with an increase of 62% in the last three years. See our latest analysis for Bed Bath & Beyond Because Bed Bath & Beyond made a loss in the last twelve months, we think the market is probably more focussed on revenue and revenue growth, at least for now. Generally speaking, companies without profits are expected to grow revenue every year, and at a good clip. As you can imagine, fast revenue growth, when maintained, often leads to fast profit growth. In the last year Bed Bath & Beyond saw its revenue shrink by 17%. We're a little surprised to see the share price pop 240% in the last year. This is a good example of how buyers can push up prices even before the fundamental metrics show much growth. It's quite likely the revenue fall was already priced in, anyway. You can see how earnings and revenue have changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values). It's good to see that there was some significant insider buying in the last three months. That's a positive. That said, we think earnings and revenue growth trends are even more important factors to consider. If you are thinking of buying or selling Bed Bath & Beyond stock, you should check out this free report showing analyst profit forecasts. It's nice to see that Bed Bath & Beyond shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 240% over the last year. That certainly beats the loss of about 3% per year over the last half decade. This makes us a little wary, but the business might have turned around its fortunes. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Like risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted 2 warning signs for Bed Bath & Beyond (of which 1 is potentially serious!) you should know about.

JULIE HYMAN: But first, we got to talk about AMC, don't we? The company out with a surprise filing this morning, saying it's going to be selling 11 and 1/2 million additional shares, registering to sell them. But what really stood out to us, of course, from this filing was the language within it, and this quote in particular. ""Under the circumstances,"" reads the filing, ""we caution you against investing in our class A common stock, unless you're prepared to incur the risk of losing all or a substantial portion of your investment."" Now, it's not unusual to see sort of caveats, legalese in these types of filings. But even by those standards, this is fairly extraordinary. Here's a bunch more shares to buy. But you might not want to actually do that-- is an interesting move to take. Again, legally, I understand why they have to say it. But it's still pretty stark, Myles, when they actually do. MYLES UDLAND: Yeah. And you know, in addition to that-- and I would encourage viewers who are interested-- and I'm sure many already have-- I would encourage them to go read the rest of the filing. Because there are one, two, three, four, five additional bullet points of caveats on crazy things that have happened with shares of AMC and that may or may not happen to shares of AMC in the future. But again, I think it's quite a shrewd move here on the part of management to come to market for the second time in a week when you have this kind of action in your shares. And you know, I just put a post up on Yahoo Finance that a lot of the AMC bulls think is wrong. They're telling me to read the filing. I tell you to read the filing.

See: AMC Files to Sell 11.5 Million Shares, Advises Investors Not to Buy as Stock Tumbles
Find: Musk’s ‘Baby Shark’ Tweet, Reddit Meme Stocks Redux & AMC Beach Banner Drive Market Frenzy — You Should Play It Cool The most recent increase was largely driven by a new rewards program that includes a free large popcorn. The day after reaching this new high, AMC announced plans to sell 11.55 million shares and sent the stock tumbling. The shares sold for an average of $50.85 and closed at $55 yesterday. The prices might not seem that wild considering other stocks sell for hundreds of dollars, but to put it into perspective, AMC increased 400% in the past month alone. Yahoo! Finance reports that Macquarie analysts have reconfirmed their $6 price target and neutral rating on AMC in early afternoon trading last Thursday. While there is optimism for a post-pandemic rebound for box-office in general, analysts remained concerned about the company’s balance sheet overall. For reference, the cost of a movie ticket at an AMC theater is about $14, making the company’s stock value less than half the cost of one of its tickets to see a film. It is not difficult to justify a drastically lower valuation compared to current market price. AMC’s best-ever full net profit earnings was in 2016, with $111.7 million — long before the pressures of COVID-19 brought the industry to a full stop. Business Service News reports that operating cash flow stagnated as the company was forced to spend more and borrow more to grow its sales. AMC’s current market capitalization of about $25 billion is 225 times the company’s best-ever net profit. In a year when movie theaters virtually shut down full operations due to a global pandemic, this just doesn’t make sense.  See: Watch Out for These Stock Sell Offs

The shares closed at $66.80 Friday. The pandemic has caused AMC's long-term debt levels to soar to $5.4 billion as of the first three months of this year from less than $2 billion in 2016. And it’s still losing money, with analysts expecting another $100 million to go over the next 12 months.

2021-06-03T12:15:27.000Z,AMC just dropped the hammer on every meme stock CEO,"The Meme Market is back with a vengeance.  And AMC (AMC) is playing a different game the second time around.  On Thursday morning, the company filed to sell up to an additional 11.5 million shares as its stock price continues a monster run higher.  On Wednesday alone AMC shares rose 95% and in pre-market trading on Thursday the stock was at one point up another 20%.  But this does not mark the company's first effort to capitalize on recent volatility.  Earlier this week AMC raised $230 million from Mudrick Capital in an offering the company said ""will allow us to be aggressive in going after the most valuable theatre assets, as well as to make other strategic investments in our business and to pursue deleveraging opportunities.""  On Wednesday, the company announced a new shareholder platform that will offer investors perks at actual movie theaters, including free popcorn. As we wrote in Thursday's Morning Brief, a company's stock is its currency and AMC is currently using a sharp rise in the value of this currency to improve its actual business.  And with all these moves, AMC CEO Adam Aron and the whole executive team at the company are putting the pressure on their peers running other companies caught up in the meme trade to not just let this market moment come and go. These are episodes that management teams must cash in on.  Back in the winter when GameStop (GME) was the focal point of the first meme stock rally that management team sat on its hands for months. And now GameStop is in the process of looking for a new CEO.  And while the rally in AMC and other meme names right now might not make sense, from the vantage point of a management team that tries to create value for shareholders the way to respond to this interest is clear: you sell stock until the market can't take it anymore.  AMC's filing on Thursday also does not obligate the company to sell additional shares now or at any time. It merely allows AMC to reserve the right to sell stock.

2021-06-07T18:17:49.000Z,Reddit’s WallStreetBets has a new favorite stockFortune,"GameStop and AMC are trading at levels no one could have imagined a year ago. Now, Reddit’s r/WallStreetBets community is looking for the next company whose stock is set to explode—and seems to have settled on Blackberry. The company behind the once iconic line of pagers and smartphones has seen its shares increase 137% year to date. That’s nothing compared to the 1,472% increase in GameStop and the 2,705% bump for AMC, but it’s the biggest surge the company has seen in two years. And, judging by chatter on r/WallStreetBets, interest is growing. A look at the subreddit Monday finds seven of the top 20 posts are dedicated solely to Blackberry. (Four others are focused on praising Clover Health Investments.) The stock is currently trading in the $15-$16 range, but the most enthusiastic investors are hoping to see it hit $50. “Don’t stop, BBelieving!!” encouraged user TehlorO. Meanwhile, user Substantial_Diver_34 showed a screenshot of what he says is his portfolio that is 100% committed to Blackberry, with over 6,400 shares. It was, at the time of the shot, down $14,000. The post is entitled “What have I done?” Other users gave nothing but encouragement. “I'll tell you what you've done: You've guaranteed your place amongst the millionares,” wrote kingandr3, while Firesice offered “You put in a winning bid...just needs a little time.” WSB bulls say Blackberry has grown from being a phone company to a cybersecurity firm that has deals with [hotlink]Amazon[/hotlink] and others and could be well positioned to take a position in the electric vehicle marketspace. Analysts aren’t as sure. Four firms currently have “Sell” ratings on the company, with only one suggesting investors buy. Of course, the r/WallStreetBets effect often defies the logic of analysts. AMC and [hotlink]GameStop[/hotlink] were floundering a year ago. Now, their stock prices and market caps have increased so much in recent months that they could join the Russell 1000 by the end of the month.

2021-06-07T14:31:20.000Z,SEC Says It’s Scrutinizing Market Swings as Meme Stocks SurgeBloomberg,"(Bloomberg) -- The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said it’s scrutinizing markets for signs of manipulation and other misconduct as AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. and other meme stocks continue to surge. “SEC staff continues to monitor the market in light of the ongoing volatility in certain stocks to determine if there have been any disruptions of the market, manipulative trading or other misconduct,” the agency said in a Monday emailed statement. “In addition, we will act to protect retail investors if violations of federal securities laws are found.” AMC resumed its upward trajectory Monday, halting two straight days of declines. The stock -- like GameStop Corp. before it -- has become a darling of retail traders. The movie-theater chain’s wild rise comes despite questionable fundamentals, prompting concerns among regulators that investors could be sitting on substantial losses if the stock plunges. The SEC has already said it’s investigating what happened with GameStop in January, with a focus on whether traders were using online message boards to dupe other investors into buying into the rally.

2021-06-07T13:33:13.000Z,Surging meme stocks like AMC and GameStop send Russell 2000 skyrocketingYahoo Finance,"Meme stock mania has been mighty kind to the small-cap Russell 2000 Index after its reconstitution last June.  The total market capitalization of the Russell 2000 Index surged 84% from last year’s reconstitution (or the addition and subtraction of new companies to the index) to $3.5 trillion, FTSE Russell said in weekend tweet. This year alone, the Russell 2000 is up more than 16% compared to a 12% gain for the S&P 500. ""In 2020, overall capitalization for the U.S. equity market stayed fairly flat, decreasing by 1%. However, we’ve seen a surge in growth in the first half of 2021 with the total market cap in the Russell 1000 reaching $44.1 trillion. We have also seen a resurgence in market capitalizations of small cap companies in the Russell 2000 reflecting the overall bounce back of U.S. equity markets following the COVID-19 recession in early 2020,"" said FTSE Russell CEO Arne Staal. To be sure, the index has been powered by massive gains in popular stocks among a new army of retail trades such as AMC (AMC) and GameStop (GME).  AMC shares have gained more than 700% in one-year's time, giving the money-losing movie theater chain a whopping $25 billion market cap. As for struggling GameStop, its stock has exploded 4,900% over the past year — it now sports a lofty $17.6 billion market cap. Given each company's bulging market caps, they are likely to be removed from the Russell 1000. The index typically showcases companies with sub $5 billion market caps.  Currently, the smallest company in the Russell 2000 Index is Velocity Financial (VEL). It boasts a market cap of $257.1 million, an increase of 171.2% from $94.8 million in 2020.  FTSE Russell's changes to its various indexes will take place after U.S. stock markets close on June 25. The company points out the reconstitution will impact more than $10.6 trillion in investor assets benchmarked to, or invested in, products based on the Russell U.S. indexes.

2021-06-03T10:00:23.000Z,The meme market is alive and well,"This article first appeared in the Morning Brief. Get the Morning Brief sent directly to your inbox every Monday to Friday by 6:30 a.m. ET. Subscribe Thursday, June 3, 2021 When the market moves at the speed of AMC (AMC) it can be hard to keep up.  But all we can tell readers for sure is that the Meme Market is back.  On Wednesday alone, AMC shares nearly doubled, rising 95% to close at a record $62.55. AMC's market cap is now just north of $28 billion. Since the beginning of May, AMC stock is up more than 500%. Year-to-date, shares have gained about 3,000%.  The superlatives can go on. AMC was not alone, however. Shares of Bed, Bath & Beyond (BBBY), Express (EXPR), and BlackBerry (BB) all rose more than 30% on Wednesday. Even our old friends at GameStop (GME) got involved, rising some 13% amid a broad rally in meme names widely discussed on reddit and elsewhere.  But after the GameStop saga of mid-winter came and went, the market's energy moved into areas like NFTs and cryptocurrencies. Dogecoin (DOGE-USD) became a better indicator of risk sentiment than the VIX. In the background of all this the major U.S. stock indexes were treading water, minding their own business as the economy continued to rebound from last year's recession.  Along the way, the Morning Brief highlighted survey data from Deutsche Bank published in late February that suggested retail traders had no plans to leave the market. In April, fund flow data from Bank of America showed retail investors were still buying stocks while institutions were lightening up on their equity exposure.   A redux of this winter's full-on meme market, however, seemed unlikely.  And yet here we are.  The differences between the winter's GameStop episode and the present mania, of course, are many.  There has not yet been the emergence of a broad ""Wall Street vs. Main Street"" dynamic quite yet. Self-promotors from the world of tech, and crypto, and sports betting haven't inserted themselves into the present conversation with the same enthusiasm as was seen back in February. It seems these folks made a quick buck and promoted their own platforms enough the first time around.

[MUSIC PLAYING] RACHEL FOX: Hey, option traders. For today's Option Review, we're going to take a look at what's going on in AMC and a few other stocks, as the Reddit Wallstreetbets crowd is clearly targeted a handful of companies yesterday once again. AMC's stock jumped 95% yesterday. And luckily for call option buyers, they were able to cash in on the massive move throughout the day. AMC, along with other stocks, such as BlackBerry and Bed, Bath, and Beyond, saw massive call option volume as retail traders continued to squeeze institutional investors out of their short trades. AMC, BlackBerry, and Bed, Bath, and Beyond options were the most actively traded of any stock or ETF on the day. So let's take a look at these stocks together to see which specific option contract was the most highly targeted. So we're on my ThinkorSwim dashboard. And first, we're going to look at AMC's stock. So I have the ticker typed in up here. We're going to look at options contracts that expire the week of June 4, which June 4 is tomorrow. So they expire tomorrow. The highest volume contract was the 73 straight calls, which traded over 233,000 contracts. And the calls were up 2,462% on the day. And for BlackBerry, ticker symbol BB, it was the June 4 15-strike call, which is right here. And that one had traded 136,000 contracts. And that's what had the most volume. But there was also the June 18 43-strike call, which is all the way down here. And that saw the biggest percentage gain at 1,450%. Clearly, out-of-the-money calls are a favorite for Wallstreetbets traders. And finally, let's take a look at Bed, Bath, & Beyond saw 35,000 contracts traded in the June 4 calls at the 45 strike. And those calls were up an astounding 11,080% on the day.    ",https://finance.yahoo.com/video/option-trade-review-amc-stock-093249259.html
2021-06-07T19:37:29.000Z,Meme Stock Bulls Take Back Control as Hedge Fund Battle RagesFX Empire,"After a wave of selling heading into the weekend, retail investors have wrestled back control of their favorite shorted stocks, including AMC Entertainment and GameStop. The stocks are off their highs of the day, and retail investors are convinced that something shady is going on. Short sellers are swinging back after losing USD 2.2 billion from AMC’s rally last week. There are theories of traders pulling out all the stops — including the illegal practice of naked shorting, which is currently trending on Twitter. Shares of AMC have galloped 16% today but still failed to cross the psychologically important USD 60 level, where the movie chain stock closed above on June 2 for the first time. While AMC might be off its peak, investors don’t have much to clamor about considering that the stock has skyrocketed more than 467% since early May. Fellow WallStreetBets stock GameStop is tacking on close to 11% in today’s session. The stock has gained more than 1,400% year-to-date for a market cap of USD 19.4 billion. GameStop investors have proven to be a loyal bunch as it hasn’t always been easy to hold. But those who have stuck around continue to be rewarded with more potential runway for gains. Ihor Dusaniwsky, managing director of predictive analytics at S3 Partners, revealed in a tweet that GMC and AMC each have a short squeeze risk score attached of 10 out of a possible 10. Meanwhile, the WallStreetBets crowd has taken over Twitter, with #nakedshorting trending on the social media site. To be clear, unlike regular shorting, which is legal, naked selling is not legal. It has to do with selling shares that have not been issued yet. Nonetheless, it still happens in the market. Naked shorting is how 140% of GameStop’s float can have short interest, as pointed out by Charles Payne on Fox Business. Christian, Smith & Jewell Law Firm Attorney Wes Christian said he blames the prime brokers that are custodying the assets as well as market makers for this behavior.

2021-06-07T17:44:13.000Z,"UPDATE 1-Meme-stock surge lifts AMC, BlackBerry; regulator signals concernReuters","(Updates throughout, adds bylines, quotes)    By Aaron Saldanha, Sinéad Carew and David Randall    June 7 (Reuters) - Shares of AMC Entertainment and other ""meme stocks"" supported by individual traders jumped on Monday, extending a rally in social-media favorites into a third week as message boards hummed with talk about the potential to squeeze Wall Street short-sellers.    The sharp gains, however, have caught the attention of regulators at the Securities and Exchange Commission. On Monday the agency said it is looking into signs of market manipulation given the ""volatility in certain stocks.""    The volatility has also made it challenging for analysts to cover, with two analysts in the past week dropping coverage of GameStop, the stock that was catapulted higher in January by retail investors.    Cinema operator AMC Entertainment Holdings, which almost doubled in value again last week, was last up 21.1% at $58.00 while BlackBlerry's U.S. listing climbed 15.0% to $15.94 and put it up 56% since the start of June. Canadian cannabis producer Tilray's U.S. listing, meanwhile, surged 7.1%.    ""AMC never ceases to amaze me. Just when I think that train is over, it jumps almost 10 points in the first 30 min of trading,"" one poster on Reddit wrote.    Shares of AMC are up more than 2,500% for the year to date as it has courted individual investors, while shares of video game retailer GameStop are up about 1,305% over the same time.    However some bearish investors retreated from bets against AMC on Friday as the stock fell 6.7% that day with short interest falling 74.5 million shares, or 14.9% of AMC's float by the end of trade Friday from 88.2 million on Thursday, according to S3 Partners.    Institutional investors are largely sitting on the sidelines as the meme-stock rally driven by individual investors continues.

2021-06-03T07:00:07.000Z,Bed Bath & Beyond (BBBY) Moves 62.1% Higher: Will This Strength Last?,"Bed Bath & Beyond (BBBY) shares rallied 62.1% in the last trading session to close at $44.19. This move can be attributable to notable volume with a higher number of shares being traded than in a typical session. This compares to the stock's 8.8% gain over the past four weeks. Bed Bath & Beyond stock skyrocketed after the company’s announcement to launch three more Owned Brands, as part of its transformation strategy. With the launch of the three new brands, the company will have launched six Owned Brands so far this year, keeping it ahead of track to achieve its target of introducing at least eight new Owned Brands in fiscal 2021. The launch of three new brands – Our Table, Wild Sage and Squared Away – will expand the company’s assortments in the bed, bath, kitchen and dining, storage and organization as well as home décor categories. These brands are expected to be launched in the coming weeks.

Management expects the sales penetration of Owned Brands to grow from 10% to nearly 30% within the first three years. The company’s transformation strategy focuses on modernizing its assortment and sustainably expanding margins and revenues through aggressive product development.

Price and Consensus This home goods retailer is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.09 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +104.6%. Revenues are expected to be $1.86 billion, up 42.4% from the year-ago quarter. Earnings and revenue growth expectations certainly give a good sense of the potential strength in a stock, but empirical research shows that trends in earnings estimate revisions are strongly correlated with near-term stock price movements. For Bed Bath & Beyond, the consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. And a stock's price usually doesn't keep moving higher in the absence of any trend in earnings estimate revisions. So, make sure to keep an eye on BBBY going forward to see if this recent jump can turn into more strength down the road. The stock currently carries a Zacks Rank 3 (Hold).

2021-06-02T23:49:11.000Z,Forget Meme Stocks: Buy These Strong Growth Stocks with Big Upside,"AMC Entertainment AMC shares soared nearly 100% Wednesday, while fellow so-called meme stocks Bed Bath & Beyond BBBY and GameStop GME jumped 60% and 13%, respectively. Despite these huge gains the broader market was far more subdued with all three major U.S. indexes up marginally on the day. The big meme moves occurred on another low volume day following the long Memorial Day weekend. The trading volume will likely remain far below average as summer begins and people start vacationing again. More cities around the U.S. are starting to reopen nearly completely amid the successful coronavirus vaccine push. The economic boom, coupled with the Fed’s easy money policies, supply chain setbacks, government checks, and other factors have all contributed to rising prices that brought out inflation fears after April’s 4.2% CPI figure was released. Clearly, rising prices must be monitored and Wall Street will be watching the Fed closely. But the central bank has continued to remain firm that inflation will be “transitory.” Investors should also know that even if the Fed is forced to raise rates, yields will likely remain historically low, extending there is no alternative investing. For example, the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield has moved slightly above 3% only a few times in the last decade, after remaining well above the threshold in the pre-financial crisis world—it has hovered around 1.6% for much of the past three months. The current backdrop and the constantly improving earnings picture, provides clarity as to why the bulls pushed the S&P 500 back up near its records and have the tech-heavy Nasdaq above its 50-day morning average. And the benchmark index is up around 25% from its pre-pandemic levels last February, which paints a far less overheated picture compared to its over 80% run off the March lows. With this in mind, investors might want to consider adding growth focused stocks to their portfolios that are still trading below their highs, even as the meme stocks soar once again…                     ",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/forget-meme-stocks-buy-strong-234911867.html
2021-06-02T21:58:30.000Z,Bed Bath & Beyond Advances the Private Brand Rollout,"Bed Bath & Beyond will launch another three new owned brands this quarter, furthering the company’s strategy to modernize its assortment and build up margins and revenues through aggressive product development. The three launches, which brings the number of owned brands BB&B introduced so far this year to six, are: More from WWD Fall 2021 Men’s Collections • Our Table, described as a “modern” collection of cookware, bakeware, food prep, kitchen gadgets and utensils, kitchen linens, dining and barware with a total of more than 1,100 items. • Wild Sage, a “youthful, eclectic collection of 600 stylish and free-spirited products for the bedroom, bathroom, dining room, and living spaces.” • Squared Away, a line of 300 storage, organization, and cleaning solutions for the home. “I am pleased that we are ahead of schedule in delivering our owned brands plan, launching product assortments strategically sequenced to cover our core destination categories of bed, bath, kitchen and dining, indoor decor and storage and organization,” Mark Tritton, president and chief executive officer of Bed Bath & Beyond, said in a statement. As reported, BB&B launched the Simply Essential, Haven and Nestwell owned brands last quarter and is on track to have introduced a total of at least eight owned brands when the 2021 fiscal year ends in February 2022. Owned brands can also be referred to as private brands. The introduction of at least 10 new private brands is a key component of the company’s previously unveiled three-year transformation strategy, which also involves eliminating product redundancies and unproductive stock keeping units, store remodels and store closings. Owned brands at BB&B is expected to triple, from representing 10 percent of BB&B’s volume to about 30 percent over three years while driving improvements in gross margins. “Through the use of new, data-driven line reviews, we discovered there were significant opportunities to strengthen our assortment in our kitchen, home decor and storage and organization categories,” said Joe Hartsig, executive vice president, chief merchandising officer of BB&B and president of Harmon Stores. “We identified meaningful gaps where we could bring exceptional quality, style and value to our customers and help us address unmet customer needs with these exciting new lines only available at Bed Bath & Beyond. The upcoming launches of Our Table, Wild Sage and Squared Away will be important new enablers as part of our broader room resets that help elevate our overall customer experience, particularly in these important destination categories.”",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bed-bath-beyond-advances-private-215830130.html
2021-06-07T05:34:01.000Z,Did You Miss Bed Bath & Beyond's (NASDAQ:BBBY) Impressive 240% Share Price Gain?Simply Wall St.,"Unfortunately, investing is risky - companies can and do go bankrupt. But when you pick a company that is really flourishing, you can make more than 100%. For example, the Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. (NASDAQ:BBBY) share price has soared 240% in the last year. Most would be very happy with that, especially in just one year! It's also up 25% in about a month. And shareholders have also done well over the long term, with an increase of 62% in the last three years. See our latest analysis for Bed Bath & Beyond Because Bed Bath & Beyond made a loss in the last twelve months, we think the market is probably more focussed on revenue and revenue growth, at least for now. Generally speaking, companies without profits are expected to grow revenue every year, and at a good clip. As you can imagine, fast revenue growth, when maintained, often leads to fast profit growth. In the last year Bed Bath & Beyond saw its revenue shrink by 17%. We're a little surprised to see the share price pop 240% in the last year. This is a good example of how buyers can push up prices even before the fundamental metrics show much growth. It's quite likely the revenue fall was already priced in, anyway. You can see how earnings and revenue have changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values). It's good to see that there was some significant insider buying in the last three months. That's a positive. That said, we think earnings and revenue growth trends are even more important factors to consider. If you are thinking of buying or selling Bed Bath & Beyond stock, you should check out this free report showing analyst profit forecasts. It's nice to see that Bed Bath & Beyond shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 240% over the last year. That certainly beats the loss of about 3% per year over the last half decade. This makes us a little wary, but the business might have turned around its fortunes. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Like risks, for instance.

2021-06-07T05:34:01.000Z,Did You Miss Bed Bath & Beyond's (NASDAQ:BBBY) Impressive 240% Share Price Gain?Simply Wall St.,"Unfortunately, investing is risky - companies can and do go bankrupt. But when you pick a company that is really flourishing, you can make more than 100%. For example, the Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. (NASDAQ:BBBY) share price has soared 240% in the last year. Most would be very happy with that, especially in just one year! It's also up 25% in about a month. And shareholders have also done well over the long term, with an increase of 62% in the last three years. See our latest analysis for Bed Bath & Beyond Because Bed Bath & Beyond made a loss in the last twelve months, we think the market is probably more focussed on revenue and revenue growth, at least for now. Generally speaking, companies without profits are expected to grow revenue every year, and at a good clip. As you can imagine, fast revenue growth, when maintained, often leads to fast profit growth. In the last year Bed Bath & Beyond saw its revenue shrink by 17%. We're a little surprised to see the share price pop 240% in the last year. This is a good example of how buyers can push up prices even before the fundamental metrics show much growth. It's quite likely the revenue fall was already priced in, anyway. You can see how earnings and revenue have changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values). It's good to see that there was some significant insider buying in the last three months. That's a positive. That said, we think earnings and revenue growth trends are even more important factors to consider. If you are thinking of buying or selling Bed Bath & Beyond stock, you should check out this free report showing analyst profit forecasts. It's nice to see that Bed Bath & Beyond shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 240% over the last year. That certainly beats the loss of about 3% per year over the last half decade. This makes us a little wary, but the business might have turned around its fortunes. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance.

2021-06-02T20:49:44.000Z,"AMC, Bed Bath & Beyond, Workhorse Rally in Postmarket Trading","(Bloomberg) -- AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. and some of its meme-stock peers continued Wednesday’s surge in after-hours trading. AMC was up 12% at 4:27 p.m. in New York, with retail traders showing no interest in taking profits, despite a two-day gain of 139% that sent shares to a record high. Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. jumped as much as 9.5% in the postmarket session after closing up 62%. And electric-vehicle company Workhorse Group Inc., which has also been a popular name on forums like Reddit’s WallStreetBets, added 17% in late trading, following its 20% regular-session gain. The mania is similar to that seen early in the year, when GameStop Corp. surged 1,642% over 11 sessions. AMC’s market value hit $31 billion Wednesday, surpassing the video-game retailer’s $21 billion. Earlier Wednesday, AMC announced that it will reward its retail investors with special screenings and free popcorn. A day earlier, it raised $230 million directly from creditor Mudrick Capital Management.

2021-06-02T18:07:13.000Z,Bed Bath & Beyond launches new brands as retail investors send stock skyrocketing,"Let's just say that investors really, really, REALLY love that Bed Bath & Beyond (BBBY) introduced three new, high margin private label brands on Wednesday.  Shares of the home goods retailer exploded by as much as 50% in afternoon trading as retail traders returned to old friend Bed Bath & Beyond (and meme trades such as AMC and BlackBerry) amid its positive product news. The company said it will debut the three new home brands —Our Table, Wild Sage and Squared Away — in the coming weeks as part of CEO Mark Tritton's ongoing revival of the business. Bed Bath and Beyond has now unveiled six new private label brands in five months. It plans to release two more by February 2022. The company is targeting 10 new private label brands overall within the next three years. Tritton told Yahoo Finance Live he is staying focused on executing the turnaround plan rather than getting swept up into watching the surging stock price.  ""I can honestly say this is not distracting. We believe in the plan,"" Tritton said. That's good seeing as Tritton has big goals on tap for Bed Bath & Beyond. The company plans to invest $1 billion to $1.5 billion in the business over the next three years. During that stretch, Tritton will earmark $250 million to remodel some 60% of Bed Bath & Beyond stores. The rest of the funds will be split between improvements to e-commerce technology and the supply chain. Money will be spent on launching the aforementioned 10 new private label brands. Bed Bath & Beyond is targeting low- to mid-single digit same-store sales growth by 2023 and $1 billion in operating profits. The moves are paying off already.   Bed Bath & Beyond notched its third straight quarter of same-store sales gains in its most recent quarter amid better merchandising and promotional strategies. Adjusted operating profits rose 13% in the quarter from a year ago. Brian Sozzi is an editor-at-large and anchor at Yahoo Finance. Follow Sozzi on Twitter @BrianSozzi and on LinkedIn.

[MUSIC PLAYING] ZACK GUZMAN: Well, AMC shares are not the only meme stock catching a bid today. One of those names talked about in Reddit's Wall Street Bets, Bed Bath and Beyond seeing a 50% spike higher in today's session. But it's not just that retail enthusiasm we got to talk about today, as Bed Bath and Beyond says that it's looking to supercharge its efforts around the upcoming summer shopping season with the launch of a trio of in-house brands. The new lines, dubbed Our Table, Wild Sage, and Squared Away, will roll out in the coming weeks and focusing on important areas of life tied to back-to-college purchases. The Wild Sage and Squared Away segments, for example, include youthful new designs, and Squared Away offers new storage solutions. And joining us now for more on all of those efforts is the CEO of Bed Bath and Beyond, Mark Tritton joining us here, alongside Yahoo Finance's Brian Sozzi as well. And Mark, a very interesting time to be having this conversation, but seems like an important turnaround here. I mean, annual sales have been down the last three years. How will this rollout help avoid a four-peat here? MARK TRITTON: Well, we've been turning around the business, in true turnaround mode. We have our three-year plan that we articulated back in October of 2020. And we're really beginning to step into that plan and produce positive results. So quarter in, quarter out, we have been generating positive comps, inhibited by the COVID within a lot of our stores were closed. Now we're really freely operating and able to bring our strategies to life. And one of those key strategies is around creating an authority through our assortment, really led by our own brands that we introduced in the first quarter, three brands, and now three further brands in the second quarter, and as you said, in readiness for that all important back-to-college period.

2021-06-07T14:10:04.000Z,Google fined $270M from France over ad practicesYahoo Finance Video,"Yahoo Finance’s Andy Serwer, Brian Sozzi, Myles Udland, and Julie Hyman discuss Google’s antitrust settlement with France, and what it means for the future of big tech. [MUSIC PLAYING] JULIE HYMAN: Google has agreed to pay $270 million to French regulators as part of a settlement related to its advertising technology business. And of course, big tech's been under scrutiny in a lot of different places, particularly in the EU, on a number of different fronts. Our Editor-in-Chief Andy Serwer has been watching all of these developments. And Andy, we keep wondering if something's going to happen here on the regulatory front when it comes to big tech. I don't know if this is sort of too specific to be applied elsewhere, or if you think this is sort of a roadmap. ANDY SEWER: You know it's another drip, Julia, is the way I would look at it. And these things all bear watching. I mean, to your point, it's not really moving the stock and that's not surprising for two reasons. One, the amount of money here at stake is small for Google. A $270 million fine. To put that in perspective, revenue last quarter is $55 billion, so that's less than 1/2 of 1% of a quarter's revenue. Now, the French said that the fine actually speaks to the amount of money here that the company made in this specific business that it thinks was due to the monopolistic practices, and I'll get back to that in a second. So that's the first reason, it's not a lot of money. And second of all, it's just in one country. It's not even pertaining to the entire EU. But it is part of a growing list, if you will, of actions taken by, not only foreign countries, but also states that are problematic for Google in some total. MYLES UDLAND: You know, Andy, I think it might be the kind of cynical journalism way to play this, that Google wants to just pay this money because it is a better outcome, an easier outcome, as you outlined for the company than dealing with any kind of regulation. And I do wonder, from the regulator's point of view, many of them part of elected administrations and certainly have an agenda and want to have accomplishments to say, we fine company X for this. I do wonder if all these companies-- they all say, I invite regulation, they're saying I invite fines because fines are short-term, fines will come and go, fines won't harm our business. But the kind of regulation that investors are worried about, but obviously are not really pricing in, is the stuff that takes 5, 10, 15 years to go through and overhauls the business. It seems like we're very far away from that sort of event for these companies.     ",https://finance.yahoo.com/video/google-fined-270m-france-over-141004383.html
2021-06-07T13:27:28.000Z,"Meme stock favorites start the week higher, GameStop earnings in focusYahoo Finance Video","Yahoo Finance's Myles Udland, Julie Hyman and Brian Sozzi break down how meme stocks are faring ahead of this week's inflation data. JULIE HYMAN: Well, as we look ahead to that inflation data, as we saw last week, markets abhor a vacuum, a news vacuum. And so one of the things that leapt into the breach were meme stocks last week and AMC in particular, as we saw that stock rise-- I think 86% was the final tally when all was said and done, even with a dip late in the week. the shares are up another 4.5% here this morning. Myles, I'm sure you were doing some deep thinking on the meme stock front over the course of the weekend and whether we would continue to see a lot of this action. I don't know that we know what exactly sparked the rally that we saw last week or the renewed interest in it, but it doesn't feel like that it's necessarily going away. MYLES UDLAND: No, I think the more that I think about it, the more that we cover these meme stocks as, really, the most interesting sub-story within the market-- because all the conversation we were just having with Brian and the direction of the economy, that's heady stuff. That is where the base of the trajectory for all of this is really formed. But the activity with meme stocks underneath the surface and the fact that it has now come up in essentially the same form a couple of times within three months-- and yet, as we discussed with Jared last week, and I'm sure we'll talk about as we get through this week, the lack of spillover between what's happened in the meme names and how sentiment within the broader market is reflected, I think, to me is the most instructive part of this story right now. I know there were a few stories out from a variety of publications over the weekend about the index industry and how some of the rally in the meme names opens that up to distortions within the construction of the index. Because obviously, if you have a market-cap-weighted index or market-cap-weighted type fund, and AMC is now double the size that it was, quadruple the size that it was, it can move that index or fund around a little bit more. Of course, if you're talking about the Russell 2000 or you're talking about even a sector-level index, its weighting is going to be still in the fractions of percentage points.

2021-05-28T20:04:09.000Z,AMC surpasses $12B market cap as Redditor asks if it can go 'to the moon',"Shares of AMC Entertainment (AMC) surged over 45% in afternoon trading Thursday, pushing the market capitalization of the country's largest theater chain past $12 billion amid a boost from retail investors. At market close on Thursday, AMC was still up over 35% with a market value of just $11.94 billion. On Friday morning at 8:30 a.m. EDT, shares were up nearly 12% in pre-market trading and up 22% after the market open at 9:45 a.m. EDT. The stock fell in midday trading and was down 2% as of 1:20 p.m. EDT.  The stock was down 1.4% at market close on Friday. AMC, which narrowly avoided bankruptcy earlier this year, belongs to a class of so-called meme stocks including GameStop (GME) and Bed Bath and Beyond (BBBY). Retail investors active on the subreddit WallStreetBets have crowded into stocks of these underdog companies in an effort to force short sellers to buy them to cover their positions. This squeeze on short sellers drives the stock prices even higher. Brick-and-mortar video game retailer GameStop, the most notable meme stock, soared over 15% on Wednesday and added another 5% on Thursday. Retail traders on WallStreetBets talked up AMC on Thursday, with one calling the theater a ""rocket ship,"" another urging fellow Redditors ""don't sell!"" and still another asking if it ""can go to the moon?"" Shares of the theater chain closed at $26.52 on Thursday, up from around $14 on May 17, when they were also rallying. The chain fell below $2 at the start of the year, a few weeks before it received a $917 million cash boost from investors to help it stave off bankruptcy. Taking advantage of the recent gains, AMC said earlier this month that it had sold 43 million shares at $9.94 a share, raising a total of $428 million. That move came as the hashtag ""AMCsqueeze"" began trending on Twitter. Last week, Chinese real-estate conglomerate Wanda Group, which had been AMC's largest shareholder, cashed in on the recent rally by selling most of its shares in AMC.

MYLES UDLAND: All right, let's take a look now at the meme trade because as we mentioned, I mean, it is full on back in this market. AMC is now the star of the show, taking over from GameStop. But let us not sleep on GameStop, which has had a huge week. AMC shares, as we noted in the premarket, up about 15%. And Julie, we see the heat map here of some of these meme names. But I am just shocked to see AMC up about 35% over the last week, up 17% in premarket trade. And we talked to Rich Greenfield a week ago. And he was sort of, like, telling us, reminding us that this is still a very much a passionate Reddit trade. And I think I had certainly fallen asleep on it. And here we are, with gains now looking-- stocks basically doubled in just a couple of weeks. JULIE HYMAN: Yeah, and you know how he reminded us, he said that AMC is not a good business and still is in secular decline. I wrote up that story and got quite a lot of Twitter hate from folks who are still short squeezing that stock. So that was a little bit of a wake up call for me personally to know that people on Reddit were still paying attention to the likes of an AMC. Pretty incredible, isn't it? I'm actually going to switch on over since we're looking at AMC because I am curious to look at that sort of longer term chart. There's a two-year chart of AMC. I mean, look at that thing. It's just kind of amazing. The thing was obviously left for dead, right? And then we saw the initial spike, the spike now, obviously, larger even than that. We got some interesting numbers, by the way, from Bespoke Investment Group that also talks about sort of the magnitude of the activity around AMC. They report-- they said that yesterday, AMC stock alone made up nearly 2/3 of the New York Stock Exchange consolidated turnover. And they said the NYSE is only one trading venue, but still, even as a sample, it was consisting of so much of that trading volume and turnover, $16 billion traded. It's just kind of staggering to think about, guys.                 ",https://finance.yahoo.com/video/amc-pops-reddit-traders-double-133617963.html

2021-05-27T10:25:37.000Z,Bed Bath & Beyond Partners with DoorDash to Expand Same-Day Delivery,"Bed Bath & Beyond (BBBY) has partnered with DoorDash (DASH) to expand its home delivery service. The two are coming together to make it easier and more convenient for customers to shop online. The same-day delivery partnership builds on a successful launch in Canada last month. DoorDash Delivery, the platform that ensures direct delivery, will power Bed Bath & Beyond’s Same Day Delivery service. Its integration will expand the same-day delivery service to over 3,000 zip codes across the nation. (See DoorDash stock analysis on TipRanks) Bed Bath & Beyond will now be able to deliver items at people’s homes the same day from almost all retail outlets, offering customers increased efficiency in online shopping. Once a purchase is made, DoorDash will pick up and deliver the package to the specified address, without interacting with the customers. (See Bed Bath & Beyond stock analysis on TipRanks) ""We're executing on our strategy to being an omni-always retailer to provide customers with the convenience of Buy-Online-Pickup-In-Store, contactless Curbside Pickup, and multiple Same Day Delivery options through existing partnerships with Shipt, Instacart and now Door Dash,"" said Bed Bath & Beyond EVP Rafeh Masood. Credit Suisse analyst Lavesh Hemnani has initiated coverage of the stock with a Hold rating. According to the analyst, the company's 10-times forward earnings are a discount to other retailers who are exposed to the housing market. However, Bed Bath and Beyond faces significant risk of operating margin erosion and slowing square footage growth. The analyst has a $19 price target on the stock, implying 28.30% downside potential to current levels. Consensus among analysts on Wall Street is a Hold based on 1 Buy, 8 Hold and 2 Sell ratings.

2021-05-17T17:49:24.000Z,"AMC stock roars amid boost from Reddit, meme stock squeeze","Shares of movie theater chain AMC Entertainment (AMC) rallied in midday trading on Monday, following a surge last week and amid a renewed push on Reddit to squeeze short sellers. AMC, which was hit especially hard by COVID-19 lockdowns, is one of a group of heavily shorted so-called meme stocks — including GameStop (GME) and Bed Bath and Beyond (BBBY). Retail investors active on Reddit have bought up these stocks in an effort to force short sellers to buy them, as well to cover their losses — driving the companies' stock prices even higher. The theater chain— whose shares have spiked over 500% this year — started last week trading at $9.90, closed Thursday at $12.77, and hit a high of $14.38 on Monday, up over 5% on the day.  Taking advantage of the recent gains, the largest theater chain in the U.S. said last week that it had sold 43 million shares at $9.94 a share, raising a total of $428 million. That move came as the hashtag ""AMCsqueeze"" began trending on Twitter. The gains come after the movie theater chain was hammered by a global pandemic that resulted in a $4.59 billion loss in 2020 compared to $149 million the year prior. Recently, though, CEO Adam Aron suggested that AMC fared better than other movie theater chains.  During a call with analysts after reporting its first-quarter results earlier this month, Aron said its market share had ""soared"" by 25% compared to pre-pandemic levels.  “We’ve taken share from those who stayed closed or those who have gone bankrupt,” according to a Wall Street Journal report. Smaller chains like Alamo Drafthouse have filed for bankruptcy and closed a number of locations. AMC may also benefit from increased vaccination rates, with 37% of the U.S. population now fully vaccinated. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, predicted last month that Americans could potentially go to the movies without wearing masks by the fall or early winter.

2021-05-14T17:47:35.000Z,People are still obsessed with buying stuff for their home post COVID-19 pandemic: BofA,"Consumers may be venturing back outside post COVID-19 vaccination, but the love gained for their home during the pandemic hasn't abated.  At least as seen through the affinity for buying home-related merchandise to make things a bit comfier.  Average daily spending for the week ending May 8 at home improvement retailers increased 35.1% versus the comparable week of 2019 and 5.9% year-over-year, according to Bank of America's analysis of spending on its debit and credit cards. For housing-related services, average daily spending grew 46.1% for the week ending May 8 versus the same week of 2019. The sales gain marked a 37.7% pop from a year ago as COVID-19 restrictions have eased amid increased vaccinations, allowing contractors to safely enter one's home.  The sales strength extended into home furnishings, too. Average daily spending at home furnishings retailers for the week ending May 8 increased 35.3% compared to the similar week in 2019. Sales surged 73.7% from a year ago.  ""We still feel good about the outlook for the year and just have so much demand right now... it's just off the charts,"" Sonos CEO Patrick Spence said on Yahoo Finance Live.  People investing in their homes during the pandemic remained a major tailwind for Sonos in its most recent quarter. The speaker maker said Wednesday that quarterly sales nearly doubled year-over-year. It warned that demand is so strong for its various lines of speakers that it continues to deal with out of stocks.  That said, there are signs emerging that robust home-related spending could cool down a bit in coming months as consumers become more mobile and stimulus checks are used up.  The Census Bureau said Friday retail sales were flat month-on-month in April, down from the revised 10.7% increase reported during the prior month. Sales in April fell compared to March in most categories, including drops at home furnishings retailers and building materials and supplies stores.

2021-05-14T15:30:03.000Z,Bed Bath & Beyond (BBBY) Down 5% Since Last Earnings Report: Can It Rebound?,"A month has gone by since the last earnings report for Bed Bath & Beyond (BBBY). Shares have lost about 5% in that time frame, underperforming the S&P 500. Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Bed Bath & Beyond due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers. Bed Bath & Beyond posted fourth-quarter fiscal 2020 results, wherein both top and bottom lines surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Results gained from advanced omni-channel capabilities and other growth strategies, including store remodeling and upgrading, improved technologies, store optimization efforts, enhanced supply chain and increased investments in buybuy BABY and Harmon banners. Also, the solid performance in baby, toddler safety, feeding, toys, educational, playroom and apparel contributed to quarterly growth. Bed Bath & Beyond reported adjusted earnings of 40 cents per share for the fiscal fourth quarter, up 5.3% year over year. Further, the figure exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 27 cents. This uptick was mainly attributed to improved margins and lower expenses.

Net sales were $2,619 million, down 16% year over year due to the sale of non-core businesses and store closures. Moreover, it surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2,613 million. Further, in-store sales fell 27% in the reported quarter.

Meanwhile, digital sales rose roughly 86% in the quarter. Several omni-channel services, such as Buy-Online-Pick-Up-In-Store and Curbside Pickup, contributed to digital sales growth. Notably, the company witnessed 3.1 million new customers in the digital space, with more than 300 million visitors on its online platforms. Also, the mobile channel accounted for more than half of its digital sales in the fiscal fourth quarter. Its mobile app was downloaded more than 21 million times, with the buybuy BABY mobile app being downloaded 150,000 times.

With roughly 87% of orders ready for pick up within two hours, BOPIS now accounts for 14% of digital sales in the quarter under review. Also, stores fulfilled 41% of digital sales, out of which 17% were BOPIS orders. Apart from these, its newly launched same-day delivery service is gaining traction with more than 220,00 same-day delivery orders in the fiscal fourth quarter. Out of these, 78% of orders came from websites while the rest were from Shipt and Instacart. Encouragingly, management launched Harmon Face Values on Instacart with the added benefit of same-day delivery for healthy and personal care products.

During the quarter, total enterprise comparable sales (comps) grew 4% year over year, marking the third successive quarter of comps growth. The metric gained from strength in the Bed Bath & Beyond banner and strong digital comps. However, comparable store sales fell 20% year over year.

Gross profit advanced 18.6% to $926.2 million in the fiscal fourth quarter. Moreover, adjusted gross margin expanded 20 basis points (bps) to 32.8% on positive product mix, higher markdowns, better promotions, and lower distribution and fulfillment costs. On the flip side, adverse digital channel mix and elevated shipping costs acted as deterrents.

Meanwhile, adjusted SG&A expenses fell 19.9% to $763 million, driven by the sale of non-core businesses and reduced occupancy costs.

Further, the company incurred an operating loss of $23.7 million compared with a loss of $81.2 million in the year-ago quarter.           ",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bed-bath-beyond-bbby-down-153003775.html

2021-05-11T15:01:03.000Z,Bed Bath & Beyond (BBBY) Launches Simply Essential Line,"With majority time being spent indoors due to the pandemic, there is more focus on making homes an enjoyable and comfortable space. Consumers have been investing in making homes well equipped for work-from-home and entertainment needs. Companies such as Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. BBBY are cashing in on this new-found appreciation for the home space by expanding their assortments. This leading retailer of home furnishing products and other domestic merchandise announced the launch of Simply Essential. This new line consists of more than 1,200 essential items, designed to suit various home needs. Markedly, the launch forms part of the company’s three-year transformation plan. Let’s dive deeper. Bed Bath & Beyond is in an assortment expansion spree. As part of its three-year transformation plan, the company will launch at least eight new Owned Brands by the end of February, 2022. Moreover, the company had earlier stated that it plans to introduce at least 10 Owned Brands in the next two years. Progressing on its growth strategy, the company announced the launch of the Simply Essential line. Exclusively available at Bed Bath & Beyond, the new assortment line has been thoughtfully designed for meeting needs across every room of a house.

Simply Essential is the company's first full-line assortment at opening price points. This assortment also marks the third Owned Brand launched by the company this year. In March, the company launched its private label brand — Nestwell — an assortment of quality bed and bath goods. The company also relaunched the Haven bath brand in April, which offers a spa-inspired assortment of organic cotton products and more.

The Simply Essential line underpins Bed Bath & Beyond's commitment to meet the needs of a wide range of customers with new value-led options, eliminating gaps in lower price brackets.

Simply Essential products are available through Bed Bath & Beyond’s omnichannel facilities, including buy online and pickup in-store or curbside, regular or same-day delivery.

2021-05-08T07:34:05.000Z,We Think Bed Bath & Beyond (NASDAQ:BBBY) Is Taking Some Risk With Its Debt,"David Iben put it well when he said, 'Volatility is not a risk we care about. What we care about is avoiding the permanent loss of capital.' So it might be obvious that you need to consider debt, when you think about how risky any given stock is, because too much debt can sink a company. We can see that Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. (NASDAQ:BBBY) does use debt in its business. But is this debt a concern to shareholders? Debt and other liabilities become risky for a business when it cannot easily fulfill those obligations, either with free cash flow or by raising capital at an attractive price. In the worst case scenario, a company can go bankrupt if it cannot pay its creditors. However, a more usual (but still expensive) situation is where a company must dilute shareholders at a cheap share price simply to get debt under control. Having said that, the most common situation is where a company manages its debt reasonably well - and to its own advantage. The first thing to do when considering how much debt a business uses is to look at its cash and debt together. View our latest analysis for Bed Bath & Beyond The image below, which you can click on for greater detail, shows that Bed Bath & Beyond had debt of US$1.20b at the end of February 2021, a reduction from US$1.49b over a year. But it also has US$1.35b in cash to offset that, meaning it has US$148.8m net cash. According to the last reported balance sheet, Bed Bath & Beyond had liabilities of US$2.29b due within 12 months, and liabilities of US$2.89b due beyond 12 months. Offsetting these obligations, it had cash of US$1.35b as well as receivables valued at US$318.1m due within 12 months. So it has liabilities totalling US$3.51b more than its cash and near-term receivables, combined. Given this deficit is actually higher than the company's market capitalization of US$2.69b, we think shareholders really should watch Bed Bath & Beyond's debt levels, like a parent watching their child ride a bike for the first time. Hypothetically, extremely heavy dilution would be required if the company were forced to pay down its liabilities by raising capital at the current share price. Given that Bed Bath & Beyond has more cash than debt, we're pretty confident it can handle its debt, despite the fact that it has a lot of liabilities in total.

Enzo Biochem, Inc., founded in the 1970s, has frustrated investors with a poor operational and share-price performance over the last several years. CorpGov has covered the story extensively. “Shareholders demonstrated their clear disapproval with the performance and leadership” by refusing to vote for Rabbani’s reelection to the board, the letter said. Roumell reported a 6% stake in the filing. A previous 13D/A filed on Jan. 15, 2021 showed a 5.8% stake. Enzo didn’t respond to a request for comment from CorpGov. “Currently, certain lawmakers in Georgia cannot seem to accept that their preferred candidate in last year’s presidential election lost, fair and square,” the letter said. “Similar to these Georgian politicians, you simply cannot accept that your candidate lost, fair and square.” The letter was sent to Mary Tagliaferri, Ian Walters, Rebecca Fischer and Dov Perlysky, in their capacity as non-executive independent directors of the Issuer. By refusing to accept the resignation of Rabbani, an incumbent director who failed to receive a majority of the votes cast at the Annual Meeting held on January 4, 2021, the members of the Board acted against the will of the Issuer’s shareholders and did not fulfill their duties as stewards of shareholder interests, the letter said.

2021-04-27T15:30:00.000Z,INVESTOR ALERT: Labaton Sucharow Pursing FINRA Arbitration for Robinhood Trading Restrictions; Traders with Losses Encouraged to Contact the Firm,"NEW YORK, NY / ACCESSWIRE / April 27, 2021 / Labaton Sucharow LLP, a premiere securities litigation law firm, announces it is pursing FINRA arbitration claims on behalf of traders using Robinhood who suffered losses in Gamestop (NYSE:GME), AMC (NYSE:AMC), Nokia (NYSE:NOK), BlackBerry (NYSE:BB), Bed Bath & Beyond (NASDAQ:BBBY), Naked Brands (NASDAQ:AKD), Koss (NASDAQ:KOSS), or Express (NYSE:EXPR) following Robinhood's decision to restrict trading. During the week of January 25, 2021, the price of Gamestop stock increased over 200% due to a large number of individual traders buying the stock, and other stocks saw similar increases. On January 28, Robinhood announced it was restricting its traders from opening new positions in Gamestop, AMC, Nokia, and other stocks. It allowed its customers to sell their positions only and closed other positions without warning. After Robinhood's announcement, the prices of Gamestop, AMC, Nokia, and many other stocks Robinhood restricted plummeted. Robinhood traders who held GME, AMC, BB, BBBY, NOK, NAKD, KOSS, or EXPR stock on January 27, 2021, are encouraged to sign up at https://clientconnect.labaton.com/case/robinhood-trading-restrictions/. Labaton Sucharow can analyze your claim and your losses, negotiate with the company, and pursue your claim in arbitration if necessary. FINRA Arbitration Arbitration is one way to resolve disputes with companies other than filing a lawsuit in court. It is a private process that is generally faster and less formal than court. Many brokers, like Robinhood, include arbitration clauses in their customer agreements, wherein customers agree to bring their disputes to arbitration and not in court. They also include ""class action waiver"" clauses that prevent customers from joining or being part of a class action. About the Firm Labaton Sucharow LLP is one of the world's leading complex litigation firms representing clients in securities, antitrust, corporate governance and shareholder rights, and consumer cybersecurity and data privacy litigation. Labaton Sucharow has been recognized for its excellence by the courts and peers, and it is consistently ranked in leading industry publications.

2021-04-23T13:15:01.000Z,Concerns Of Higher Taxes Lead to Lower Stocks,"Few things can drain the market’s energy quicker than threats of higher taxes, which is exactly what we got in Thursday’s session. The major indices may have been able to finish in the green today after another encouraging jobless claims print, but any upward movement was ruined by reports that President Biden is considering a hike in capital gains taxes.

Actually, the reports say that he proposes nearly doubling the rate to 39.6% from 20% for people making $1 million or more. Now, this is probably just the opening move in Congressional negotiations, where the Democrats hold a slim majority over the Republicans. Nevertheless, investors don’t like hearing that taxes may double, especially when they’re already skittish about a frothy market.

As a result, the major indices all dropped by nearly 1% on Thursday. The Dow dipped 0.94% (or about 321 points) to 33815.90, while the S&P was off 0.92% to 4134.98. The NASDAQ was also down by 0.94% (or nearly 132 points) to 13818.41.

Unfortunately, another fantastic jobless claims report was wasted. The number for last week was 547,000, which beat expectations that were north of 600K. It also marked a new pandemic low after bettering last week’s upwardly revised print of 586K.

The big news of the week (at least until today) has been the better-than-expected start to earnings season. However, a good report doesn't always lead to a rise in share price. Take Intel (INTC) as the latest in a long string of examples. The chipmaker beat on both the top and bottom lines after the bell today, and even raised its guidance for the full year. But it wasn't enough for the market, which was concerned with a drop in the data center segment. Shares of INTC are down 2.8% afterhours as of this writing.

Stocks have now slipped in three of the past four sessions, leaving the major indices with declines of more than 1% each heading into Friday. The Dow and S&P are on four-week winning streaks, while the NASDAQ has a three-week run.

Today's Portfolio Highlights:

Surprise Trader: Not only has Avnet (AVT) beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the past four quarters, but it has also amassed an average surprise of 389% in that time. Now it has a positive Earnings ESP for the quarter coming after the bell on Wednesday. AVT is one of the world’s largest distributors of electronic components and computer products, which makes it part of a space in the top 6% of the Zacks Industry Rank. Dave added AVT on Thursday with a 12.5% allocation, while also selling Alcoa (AA) for a 6.6% return in two weeks. Read the full write-up for more.

Insider Trader: In October of 2020, this portfolio cashed in two triple-digit profits from Bed Bath & Beyond (BBBY) as the specialty retailer was in the midst of a turnaround. So Tracey certainly paid attention when three insiders picked up shares in recent days. The CFO bought 20,000 shares on April 16, while two directors also got involved. Shares of BBBY are down 16.8% in the past month, but the company should be a big beneficiary of the upcoming economic boom. Therefore, shares look pretty cheap right now. The service had some cash on hand, so the editor added BBBY on Thursday with a 10% allocation. Get more specifics on this new addition in the complete commentary.

Counterstrike: ""Taxes are a fundamental driver of investment, so a drastic rise like that would really harm the market. While I think some hike was expected, a move this large was not. I don't think this could pass, but we have to realize this will be a big risk until the potential tax structure becomes clear.

""That being said we have a new risk. In a market that is approaching bubble territory, just a little prick can cause violent sell offs like we saw today. The S&P stopped short of yesterday's lows so the 4120 will be the one to watch over the next week.

""This week really got interesting quickly. More details on this should be out over the next 24 hours. Stay tuned!"" -- Jeremy Mullin

2021-04-22T18:54:08.000Z,Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. -- Moody's changes Bed Bath's outlook to stable; affirms Ba3 CFR,"Rating Action: Moody's changes Bed Bath's outlook to stable; affirms Ba3 CFRGlobal Credit Research - 22 Apr 2021New York, April 22, 2021 -- Moody's Investors Service, (""Moody's"") affirmed Bed Bath & Beyond Inc.'s (""Bed Bath"") corporate family rating (""CFR"") at Ba3, its probability of default rating at Ba3-PD and its senior unsecured notes rating at B1. The speculative grade liquidity rating is SGL-1. The outlook was changed to stable from negative.""The change in outlook reflects Bed Bath's continued progress on improving its profitability while increasing its digital sales penetration. Its success in the divestiture of non-core banners and the rationalization of its store base supports its ability to enact its turnaround plan. Bed Bath is expected to continue to make progress on implementing its strategic initiatives which supports its ability to maintain leverage well below 4x in 2021 despite the potential for a more normalized level of demand for home related products as consumers resume spending on travel and leisure"" said Senior Vice President, Christina Boni.Affirmations:..Issuer: Bed Bath & Beyond Inc..... Probability of Default Rating, Affirmed Ba3-PD.... Corporate Family Rating, Affirmed Ba3....Senior Unsecured Regular Bond/Debenture, Affirmed B1 (LGD5 from LGD4)Outlook Actions:..Issuer: Bed Bath & Beyond Inc.....Outlook, Changed To Stable From NegativeRATINGS RATIONALEBed Bath's Ba3 corporate family rating reflects its improvement in operating performance as customers shifted spending toward the home after the initial phase of the pandemic during which its stores were temporarily closed. The company has made considerable progress as demand has shifted to the home segment during the pandemic and as it has implemented its strategic initiatives. Bed Bath has been successful in growing its e-commerce business with an 83% increase in its digital sales in 2020, amounting to approximately 40% of its overall sales. Nonetheless the company continues to have intense competition from e-commerce and other value players and traditional discounters and remains at risk to continued market share erosion. Bed Bath continues to focus its efforts on improving assortments and layout, expanding private label, optimizing inventory and supply chain as well an enhancing its omni-channel capabilities to further its turnaround efforts. The company benefits from scale as the largest dedicated retailer of domestic merchandise and home furnishing with a national footprint and significant financial flexibility to support its continued progress. The company plans to introduce at least 8 new owned brands in fiscal 2021, with 6 launches in first six months which will support its margin expansion efforts. Additionally, Bed Bath has worked to rationalize its banners as well as its store base, closing 144 lower performing stores in 2020 with the expectation of 200 closed by the end of 2021. These efforts have enabled the company to focus on core operations and lower occupancy costs.Bed Bath's rating is also supported by its very good liquidity, its cost reduction efforts, as well as its debt reduction in 2020. Bed Bath will make strategic capital expenditures to continue to invest in stores and supply chain with its investments accelerating to $400 million this year. Bed Bath's current cash balance is approximately $1.4 billion, and its nearest note maturity is 2024 with its undrawn $850 million ABL expiring in June 2023.The stable outlook reflects Bed Bath's operating performance will continue to improve as the company enacts its business turnaround. The outlook also reflects that Bed Bath will continue to expand operating margins despite cost headwinds as online becomes a larger portion of the business. The outlook also reflects that company will maintain very good liquidity and that its financial strategy will remain balanced.FACTORS THAT COULD LEAD TO AN UPGRADE OR DOWNGRADE OF THE RATINGSAn upgrade would require that the company maintains consistent sales and operating income growth reflecting continued progress on its business transformation and stabilization of market share. Quantitatively, an upgrade would require operating margins sustained in excess of 5%, debt/EBITDA sustained below 4.0x and EBIT/interest above 2.0x while maintaining very good liquidity.Ratings could be downgraded if the company's very good liquidity position deteriorates for any reason, if it is unable to gain traction with respect to key initiatives, including the roll-out of improved omni-channel capabilities, and resetting the cost structure, or if the company experiences significant market share erosion relative to its peers. Quantitatively, ratings could be downgraded if EBIT/interest remains below 1.5x.Headquartered in Union, NJ, Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. is a onmi-channel retailer selling a wide assortment of domestics merchandise and home furnishings which operates under the names Bed Bath & Beyond, Harmon, Harmon Face Values or Face Values, buybuyBABY, and Decorist. FY 2020 revenues for the period ending February 27, 2021 were approximately $9.2 billion.The principal methodology used in these ratings was Retail Industry published in May 2018 and available at https://www.moodys.com/researchdocumentcontentpage.aspx?docid=PBC_1120379.

2021-04-19T20:21:30.000Z,"GameStop shares soar after CEO departure news, 'RoaringKitty' doubles stake","GameStop (GME) shares surged Monday by as much as 10% in early trading following news that the video game retailer's CEO George Sherman is stepping down by July 31 after just two years on the job. The stock was still up 6.26% as of market close on Monday. The news also follows moves by investor Keith Gill, who goes by ""RoaringKitty"" and ""DeepF—ingValue"" online, in which he exercised 500 call options on GameStop's stock at $12 giving him 50,000 additional shares, according to Bloomberg. Gill also bought up another 50,000 shares of the company, bringing his total stake to 200,000 shares, or more than $33 million. undefined GameStop has been the king of the so-called meme stocks including AMC (AMC) and Bed Bath & Beyond (BBBY) that took off as retail investors piled into the market amid the pandemic. Members of the Reddit board r/WallStreetBets were particularly heavy investors in GameStop, pushing the stock up more than 3,000% in the last 12 months. The trading frenzy spurred the trading platform Robinhood to temporarily halt buying of GameStop in January. The next month, the House Financial Services Committee held a hearing grilling various participants in the GameStop saga, including ""Roaring Kitty"" himself as well as the CEOs of Robinhood and Reddit. Also in February, Gill was hit with a proposed class action lawsuit claiming he misrepresented himself as an amateur investor, despite previously working in the financial services industry. Gill maintains he did not provide any investing advice during his YouTube broadcasts, in which he discussed his GameStop investments. Gill, and other investors, say they believe in GameStop's proposed turnaround plan, that will see the ailing brick and mortar retailer transform its business model to one that pushes more digital sales. The plan also calls for the company to expand its product offerings into spaces tangential to gaming including TVs, monitors, and other gaming accessories.

2021-04-19T12:00:00.000Z,"Bed Bath & Beyond Invites People To ""Escape The Noise™"" With the Spa-Inspired Haven™ Owned Brand Line Of Modern Bath Essentials","UNION, N.J., April 19, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- In a busy household, the bathroom is often the only room that can truly offer a private retreat, a place to escape the noise. In fact, a recent ""Escape the Noise"" survey, conducted by Bed Bath & Beyond (Nasdaq: BBBY), found that 40% of Americans linger in the bathroom longer than they need to just to get more alone time. The reality, however, is that many of us are settling for less-than-tranquil bathroom spaces. The survey went on to reveal that 68% of Americans believe having a space in their home dedicated to relaxation would be helpful in improving their self-care. It's no surprise that ""me-time"" is essential in helping us find balance and be our best selves.

2021-04-16T16:35:33.000Z,Consumer confidence fuels blistering sales at Bed Bath & Beyond this spring,"Consumers appear to be in the mood to buy new towels, sheets and kitchen gadgets judging by some new comments out of Bed Bath & Beyond's CEO Mark Tritton.  ""We have seen overall growth, February was strong. We saw the [retail sales] results in March come out about 10% growth. We are dramatically exceeding that growth rate in the month of March,"" Tritton tells Yahoo Finance Live.  The comments come on the heels of a blistering March retail sales report.  Retail sales last month surged a seasonally adjusted 9.8%, according to the Commerce Department, bouncing back hard from a 3% drop in February. Wall Street had expected a 5.5% increase. Strong gains were seen throughout retail in the month, namely home furnishings, online and apparel as consumers spent their stimulus checks and found new jobs with the pandemic rounding the corner.   Tritton thinks the momentum will continue in the months ahead. ""We see good things lay ahead for the quarter. We see general consumer confidence is strong, and that is strengthening in digital formats as well as store formats. I think the COVID moment is still omni-present in the minds of consumers, but confidence factors have changed definitely,"" Tritton says.  Bed Bath & Beyond (BBBY) shares rose 3.9% on Friday in the wake of Tritton's comments. The retailer's investors surely welcome the commentary and sales trends.  Shares of the home goods retailer plunged 16% this week after the company warned of more store closures in 2021 and offered a mixed first quarter outlook compared with analyst estimates. But perhaps overlooked in the initial reaction is that the turnaround under Tritton looks to be continuing.  The company notched its third straight quarter of same-store sales gains in the fourth quarter amid better merchandising and promotional strategies. Adjusted operating profits rose 13% in the quarter from a year ago.           ",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/stimulus-checks-fuel-blistering-sales-at-bed-bath-beyond-this-spring-163533862.html

BRIAN SOZZI: Bed, Bath and Beyond report another quarter of progress in its turnaround this week. Same store sales rose for the third straight quarter, and earnings handily beat analyst estimates. Yet, Bed, Bath stock was hit on the company's outlook. On the week, shares were down about 18%, bringing the year to date gain in the stock to 38%. Bed, Bath and Beyond president and CEO Mark Tritton is here with us now to talk more about the company's outlook. Mark, always good to see you here. You know, there's a lot going on inside the company. I don't have to tell you that. Is one of the takeaways for investors is that the turnaround in the company, it won't be in a straight line? MARK TRITTON: Look, I think it will be in a straight line, but patience is required. I mean, we've just come out of a COVID moment. We've gone from four years of sales declines and performance to growth. And we're seeing consistent performance in our business. And we're exactly where we believe we should be and poised for a strong 2021. I think there's just impatience around us getting there faster. And I think that we look forward to coming out in Q1 and sharing our results. And again, providing another consistent quarter of growth and performance against our estimates. BRIAN SOZZI: To that point, Mark, consumers have been out there spending very aggressively in the past few weeks, a lot of stimulus checks going through at retailers. Have you seen that in your business? MARK TRITTON: We've seen overall growth that's very, very strong. I mean, we saw the results yesterday for March come out at about 10% growth rate, dramatically exceeding that growth rate in the month of March. So we see good things lie ahead for the quarter. We're seeing general consumer confidence is strong. And that's strengthening both in digital formats, as well as store formats in that true omni [INAUDIBLE] shopping experience. So I think that the COVID moment is still omnipresent in customers' minds, but confidence factors have changed definitely.

2021-04-15T13:53:01.000Z,Bed Bath & Beyond (BBBY) Q4 Earnings & Sales Beat Estimates,"Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. BBBY posted fourth-quarter fiscal 2020 results, wherein both top and bottom lines surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Results gained from advanced omni-channel capabilities and other growth strategies, including store remodeling and upgrading, improved technologies, store optimization efforts, enhanced supply chain and increased investments in buybuy BABY and Harmon banners. Also, the solid performance in baby, toddler safety, feeding, toys, educational, playroom and apparel contributed to quarterly growth.

Shares of the company declined more than 12% during the close of the trading session on Apr 14. This might be due to sluggish traffic during the holiday season due to the pandemic-led store closures. We note that the stock has rallied 38.1% year to date, outperforming the industry’s 6.8% growth. Bed Bath & Beyond reported adjusted earnings of 40 cents per share for the fiscal fourth quarter, up 5.3% year over year. Further, the figure exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 27 cents. This uptick was mainly attributed to improved margins and lower expenses.

Net sales were $2,619 million, down 16% year over year due to the sale of non-core businesses and store closures. Moreover, it surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2,613 million. Further, in-store sales fell 27% in the reported quarter.

Meanwhile, digital sales rose roughly 86% in the quarter. Several omni-channel services, such as Buy-Online-Pick-Up-In-Store and Curbside Pickup, contributed to digital sales growth. Notably, the company witnessed 3.1 million new customers in the digital space, with more than 300 million visitors on its online platforms. Also, the mobile channel accounted for more than half of its digital sales in the fiscal fourth quarter. Its mobile app was downloaded more than 21 million times, with the buybuy BABY mobile app being downloaded 150,000 times.

With roughly 87% of orders ready for pick up within two hours, BOPIS now accounts for 14% of digital sales in the quarter under review. Also, stores fulfilled 41% of digital sales, out of which 17% were BOPIS orders. Apart from these, its newly launched same-day delivery service is gaining traction with more than 220,00 same-day delivery orders in the fiscal fourth quarter. Out of these, 78% of orders came from websites while the rest were from Shipt and Instacart. Encouragingly, management launched Harmon Face Values on Instacart with the added benefit of same-day delivery for healthy and personal care products.

During the quarter, total enterprise comparable sales (comps) grew 4% year over year, marking the third successive quarter of comps growth. The metric gained from strength in the Bed Bath & Beyond banner and strong digital comps. However, comparable store sales fell 20% year over year.

Gross profit advanced 18.6% to $926.2 million in the fiscal fourth quarter. Moreover, adjusted gross margin expanded 20 basis points (bps) to 32.8% on positive product mix, higher markdowns, better promotions, and lower distribution and fulfillment costs. On the flip side, adverse digital channel mix and elevated shipping costs acted as deterrents.

Meanwhile, adjusted SG&A expenses fell 19.9% to $763 million, driven by the sale of non-core businesses and reduced occupancy costs.

Further, the company incurred an operating loss of $23.7 million compared with a loss of $81.2 million in the year-ago quarter.        ",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bed-bath-beyond-bbby-q4-135301008.html

2021-04-15T10:27:19.000Z,Bed Bath & Beyond Reports Mixed 4Q Results; Street Says Hold,"Bed Bath & Beyond reported 4Q earnings that beat analysts’ expectations but revenues declined year-on-year. The retailer posted net sales of $2.62 billion, down 16% year-on-year versus analysts’ estimates of $2.63 billion. The company reported net EPS of $0.40, that came in ahead of consensus estimates of $0.31 per share. Bed Bath & Beyond’s (BBBY) President and CEO, Mark Tritton said, “Fiscal 2020 was a year of fast-paced transformation in which we reformed the past, overcame extraordinary circumstances of the present, and established a firm foundation for the future. Despite the challenges created by the COVID-19 pandemic, we relentlessly focused on taking purposeful and bold steps to transform our entire organization and remained true to our plans to rebuild our authority in Home and restore this iconic Company.” The company’s comparable sales indicated a rise for the third consecutive quarter, with strong digital growth of around 86% and enterprise comparable sales increasing 4% in 4Q. However, comparable store sales declined by 20% as a result of permanent store closures and BBBY divesting some of its non-core banner businesses. The 12% uptick in digital comparable sales was driven by the Bedding, Bath, Kitchen Food Prep, Bedding, Home Organization, and Indoor Décor categories. BBBY also reaffirmed its financial outlook for FY21 and expects to clock net sales of between $8 billion and $8.2 billion and adjusted EBITDA to range between $500 million and $525 million. The company also said that it will ramp up its three-year share buyback program from $825 million to $1 billion. For the fiscal first quarter, BBBY expects net sales to increase by over 40% year-on-year. Excluding the impact from the divestiture of non-core banner businesses, BBBY expects sales to grow higher by around 65% to 70%. In 1Q, the company anticipates adjusted gross margin to be around 34% and adjusted EBITDA to land between $80 million to $90 million.

2021-04-14T17:42:48.000Z,Kohl's settles with activists after getting a 'big wakeup call',"It's peace —for now — at struggling retailer Kohl's (KSS).  Kohl's said Wednesday it reached an agreement with activist investors Macellum Advisors, Ancora Holdings, Legion Partners Asset Management and 4010 Capital. As part of the agreement, Margaret Jenkins, former chief marketing officer at Denny's and El Pollo Loco, will join the board along with former Burlington Stores CEO Thomas Kingsbury.  Former Lululemon CEO Christine Day was identified by Kohl's to join the board, and agreed upon with the activist group. Day is likely to be viewed as a new ally inside Kohl's for its embattled CEO Michelle Gass, as both worked at Starbucks together in executive capacities.  The activists — notching another win with Kohl's after a highly publicized campaign against Bed Bath & Beyond led to a complete executive overhaul — had been pushing to add nine directors to Kohl's board. Kohl's also created a new finance committee of the board, which Kingsbury will join. The committee will assist the board on capital allocation decisions made by Kohl's — a key issue the activists had voiced. The company also lifted its stock buyback authorization to $2 billion.  A source familiar with the matter tells Yahoo Finance the activist campaign has been a ""big wakeup call"" to Kohl's otherwise aloof management team. The activist group plans to hold onto its 9.3% stake in Kohl's, the source said. ""I look forward to working with our newly expanded board to further advance our transformative strategy and deliver results for shareholders. Amidst ongoing industry disruption and evolving consumer trends, we are uniquely positioned to build on our momentum and accelerate growth and profitability,” Gass said in a statement.  Now it's time to get to work on fixing everything the activist group outlined in their analysis of Kohl's. The list is long, ranging from overhauling executive compensation to potentially spinning off real estate holdings. All eyes are on whether it will still be Gass and her team making these decisions once the new board members dig in.

2021-04-14T12:25:12.000Z,Bed Bath & Beyond (BBBY) Beats Q4 Earnings and Revenue Estimates,"Bed Bath & Beyond (BBBY) came out with quarterly earnings of $0.40 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.27 per share. This compares to earnings of $0.38 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items. This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 48.15%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this home goods retailer would post earnings of $0.20 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.08, delivering a surprise of -60%. Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times. Bed Bath & Beyond, which belongs to the Zacks Retail - Miscellaneous industry, posted revenues of $2.62 billion for the quarter ended February 2021, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.22%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $3.11 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates two times over the last four quarters. The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call. Bed Bath & Beyond shares have added about 66.1% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 9.9%. What's Next for Bed Bath & Beyond? While Bed Bath & Beyond has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock? There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately. Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.

There’s a lot of anticipation for this season, especially on forward looking guidance. This will be the last “pre-pandemic” year-over-year quarterly comparison.

That’s why guidance is going to be key. Top Earnings All-Stars These 5 companies are in different industries but have some of the best charts of the week.

2021-04-08T16:21:41.000Z,Best Buy is the latest retailer to attack Amazon Prime,"The beast that is Amazon Prime is under attack as major retailers seek recurring revenue streams and look to keep legions of new customers that they gained during the COVID-19 pandemic.  Electronics giant Best Buy (BBY) is the latest to step into the ring long dominated by Prime.  Best Buy said this week it has begun piloting a subscription service dubbed Best Buy Beta. For $199.99 a year, members get exclusive pricing, unlimited Geek Squad technical support, two years of protection on most product purchases, free standard shipping with no delivery minimums, and free in-home delivery and installation on certain electronics and appliances. Members also receive extended product return windows.  It marks Best Buy's first true subscription product. The service is being piloted in Iowa, Oklahoma, and eastern Pennsylvania. Expansion is already planned for Best Buy's hometown state of Minnesota, North Carolina and Tennessee.  Wall Street analysts say Best Buy Beta shouldn't come as a shock to anyone.  ""During the past 12 months, there has been a material evolution of customer shopping behavior with millions of new customers engaging with consumer electronics (many via Best Buy). Simply put, we view this pilot as Best Buy's tool to turn the billions of interactions it's had with new (and reactivated) customers over the past year into lifelong relationships by showing them the full ecosystem the retailer offers through delivery, installation, repair, and technical expertise,"" said Jefferies analyst Jonathan Matuszewski.  Matuszewski added, ""From an execution standpoint, we believe the lowest hanging fruit will be current Total Tech Support members who currently pay $199 for a fraction of the benefits included in Best Buy Beta. Next, we believe Best Buy will be targeting less loyal customers or non-customers, including those shopping consumer electronics at Amazon (via Prime), Walmart (via Walmart+), and Target.""

2021-04-08T15:59:03.000Z,Here's How Bed Bath & Beyond (BBBY) is Poised for Q4 Earnings,"Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. BBBY is slated to release fourth-quarter fiscal 2020 results on Apr 14, 2021. The leading specialty retailer is likely to deliver revenue and earnings declines in the to-be-reported quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s fiscal fourth-quarter earnings is pegged at 27 cents, suggesting a decline of 29% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure. The consensus estimate has been unchanged in the past 30 days.

The consensus estimate for fiscal fourth-quarter sales is pegged at $2.61 billion, indicating a 15.9% decrease from the prior-year quarter’s reported number.

In the last reported quarter, the company delivered an earnings miss of 60%. However, its bottom line beat estimates by 94.3%, on average, in the trailing four quarters. Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. price-eps-surprise | Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. Quote Bed Bath & Beyond is one of the few retailers that have been benefiting from consumers’ shift to online shopping amid the pandemic. The company has been witnessing robust sales trends in the digital platform since fourth-quarter fiscal 2019. Its digital unit has been gaining from Buy-Online-Pick-Up-In-Store and contactless curbside-pickup facilities. Additionally, strong digital sales have been more than offsetting the in-store comps decline, aiding comparable sales (comps) growth. The persistence of positive trends in comps and digital business is likely to have bolstered the company’s top line in the fiscal fourth quarter.

Additionally, its efforts to expedite the delivery and supply-chain network through the conversion of Bed Bath & Beyond and buybuy BABY stores in the United States and Canada into regional fulfillment centers have been paying off. Also, it partnered with Shipt to launch a same-day delivery service in its namesake and buybuy baby stores, which is likely to have aided sales. Gains from these actions are also likely to get reflected in the company’s robust digital sales results for the to-be-reported quarter.

Also, stringent cost-cutting actions and strong financial position are likely to have contributed to bottom-line growth in the fiscal fourth quarter.

Nonetheless, the company is expected to have witnessed continued COVID-related headwinds like dismal store traffic, significant shipping constraints and increased freight expenses. Also, adversities in the BABY business due to COVID-19 as well as the sale of non-core businesses and store closures are likely to have impacted the top line in the to-be-reported quarter.

On the last reported quarter’s earnings call, management predicted that the aforementioned headwinds will weigh on its fiscal fourth-quarter top line. In fact, total enterprise comps are envisioned to be nearly flat year over year, with net sales expected to decline at a double-digit rate. Moreover, in-store traffic is likely to remain drab in the fiscal fourth quarter.    ",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-bed-bath-beyond-bbby-155903599.html
2021-04-08T07:43:14.000Z,Have Insiders Been Buying Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. (NASDAQ:BBBY) Shares?,"We've lost count of how many times insiders have accumulated shares in a company that goes on to improve markedly. Unfortunately, there are also plenty of examples of share prices declining precipitously after insiders have sold shares. So we'll take a look at whether insiders have been buying or selling shares in Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. (NASDAQ:BBBY). It's quite normal to see company insiders, such as board members, trading in company stock, from time to time. However, such insiders must disclose their trading activities, and not trade on inside information. Insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing. But logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. As Peter Lynch said, 'insiders might sell their shares for any number of reasons, but they buy them for only one: they think the price will rise'. See our latest analysis for Bed Bath & Beyond In the last twelve months, the biggest single purchase by an insider was when Independent Director Sue Gove bought US$268k worth of shares at a price of US$7.89 per share. Although we like to see insider buying, we note that this large purchase was at significantly below the recent price of US$28.31. Because it occurred at a lower valuation, it doesn't tell us much about whether insiders might find today's price attractive. In the last twelve months Bed Bath & Beyond insiders were buying shares, but not selling. Their average price was about US$10.82. To my mind it is good that insiders have invested their own money in the company. However, you should keep in mind that they bought when the share price was meaningfully below today's levels. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!      ",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/insiders-buying-bed-bath-beyond-074314481.html

2021-04-07T16:30:04.000Z,Analysts Estimate Bed Bath & Beyond (BBBY) to Report a Decline in Earnings: What to Look Out for,"The market expects Bed Bath & Beyond (BBBY) to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended February 2021. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates. The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on April 14. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower. While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise. Zacks Consensus Estimate This home goods retailer is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.27 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -29%. Revenues are expected to be $2.61 billion, down 15.9% from the year-ago quarter. Estimate Revisions Trend The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period. Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Earnings Whisper Estimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction). The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.

X-A*, Affirmed Aaa (sf); previously on Oct 20, 2020 Affirmed Aaa (sf)* Reflects interest-only classesRATINGS RATIONALEThe ratings on three P&I classes were affirmed due to the significant credit support and because the transaction's key metrics, including Moody's loan-to-value (LTV) ratio, Moody's stressed debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) and the transaction's Herfindahl Index (Herf), are within acceptable ranges.The ratings on three P&I classes were downgraded due to higher anticipated losses and increased interest shortfall risk driven by the significant exposure to delinquent loans secured by regional mall loans. Specially serviced loans represent 29.5% of the pool, of which three of the four largest, representing 23.7%, are secured by regional malls. The three delinquent mall loans include Woodbridge Center (14.8% of the pool), Montgomery Mall (7.1% of the pool) and Oak Court Mall (1.9% of the pool), all of which are more than 90 days delinquent and the properties were already experiencing declining performance prior to 2020. Furthermore, significant appraisal reductions have been recognized of between 49% to 67% of the respective loan balances on these regional mall loans. As a result of the appraisal reductions, interest shortfalls have significantly increased, and Moody's anticipates these shortfalls will continue and may increase from their current levels due the performance of these loans. Furthermore, the other specially serviced loans are also at least 90 days delinquent, two of which (1.3% of the pool) have also realized appraisal reductions of 25% or more of their loan balance.The rating on the IO class was affirmed based on the credit quality of the referenced classes.The coronavirus pandemic has had a significant impact on economic activity. Although global economies have shown a remarkable degree of resilience to date and are returning to growth, the uneven effects on individual businesses, sectors and regions will continue throughout 2021 and will endure as a challenge to the world's economies well beyond the end of the year. While persistent virus fears remain the main risk for a recovery in demand, the economy will recover faster if vaccines and further fiscal and monetary policy responses bring forward a normalization of activity. As a result, there is a heightened degree of uncertainty around our forecasts. Our analysis has considered the effect on the performance of commercial real estate from a gradual and unbalanced recovery in US economic activity. Stress on commercial real estate properties will be most directly stemming from declines in hotel occupancies (particularly related to conference or other group attendance) and declines in foot traffic and sales for non-essential items at retail properties.We regard the coronavirus outbreak as a social risk under our ESG framework, given the substantial implications for public health and safety.Moody's rating action reflects a base expected loss of 17.8% of the current pooled balance, compared to 13.6% at Moody's last review. Moody's base expected loss plus realized losses is now 13.9% of the original pooled balance, compared to 10.7% at the last review. Moody's provides a current list of base expected losses for conduit and fusion CMBS transactions on moodys.com at http://www.moodys.com/viewresearchdoc.aspx?docid=PBS_SF215255.FACTORS THAT WOULD LEAD TO AN UPGRADE OR DOWNGRADE OF THE RATINGSThe performance expectations for a given variable indicate Moody's forward-looking view of the likely range of performance over the medium term. Performance that falls outside the given range can indicate that the collateral's credit quality is stronger or weaker than Moody's had previously expected.Factors that could lead to an upgrade of the ratings include a significant amount of loan paydowns or amortization, an increase in the pool's share of defeasance or an improvement in pool performance.Factors that could lead to a downgrade of the ratings include a decline in the performance of the pool, loan concentration, an increase in realized and expected losses from specially serviced and troubled loans or interest shortfalls.METHODOLOGY UNDERLYING THE RATING ACTIONThe principal methodology used in rating all classes except interest-only classes was ""Approach to Rating US and Canadian Conduit/Fusion CMBS"" published in September 2020 and available at https://www.moodys.com/researchdocumentcontentpage.aspx?docid=PBS_1244778. The methodologies used in rating interest-only classes were ""Approach to Rating US and Canadian Conduit/Fusion CMBS"" published in September 2020 and available at https://www.moodys.com/researchdocumentcontentpage.aspx?docid=PBS_1244778 and ""Moody's Approach to Rating Structured Finance Interest-Only (IO) Securities"" published in February 2019 and available at https://www.moodys.com/researchdocumentcontentpage.aspx?docid=PBS_1111179. Please see the list of ratings at the top of this announcement to identify which classes are interest-only (indicated by the *). Alternatively, please see the Rating Methodologies page on www.moodys.com for a copy of these methodologies. DEAL PERFORMANCEAs of the March 15, 2021 distribution date, the transaction's aggregate certificate balance has decreased by 21.7% to $763 million from $974 million at securitization. The certificates are collateralized by 70 mortgage loans ranging in size from less than 1% to 14.8% of the pool, with the top ten loans (excluding defeasance) constituting 50.5% of the pool. Nine loans, constituting 5.4% of the pool, have defeased and are secured by US government securities.Moody's uses a variation of Herf to measure the diversity of loan sizes, where a higher number represents greater diversity. Loan concentration has an important bearing on potential rating volatility, including the risk of multiple notch downgrades under adverse circumstances. The credit neutral Herf score is 40. The pool has a Herf of 20, compared to 21 at Moody's last review.As of the March 2021 remittance report, loans representing 67% were current or within their grace period on their debt service payments, 2% were between 30 -- 59 days delinquent and the remainder were either more than 90 days delinquent or in the foreclosure process.Seven loans, constituting 8.6% of the pool, are on the master servicer's watchlist. The watchlist includes loans that meet certain portfolio review guidelines established as part of the CRE Finance Council (CREFC) monthly reporting package. As part of Moody's ongoing monitoring of a transaction, the agency reviews the watchlist to assess which loans have material issues that could affect performance.One loan has been liquidated from the pool, resulting in a minimal loss (for a loss severity of 0.1%). Eight loans, constituting 31% of the pool, are currently in special servicing. Six of the specially serviced loans, representing almost 30% of the pool, have transferred to special servicing since May 2020.The largest specially serviced loan is the Woodbridge Center Loan ($112.6 million -- 14.8% of the pool), which represents a pari-passu portion of a $234.9 million senior mortgage loan. The loan is secured by a 1.1 million square foot (SF) component of a two-story, regional mall in Woodbridge, New Jersey. The loan is sponsored and the property is managed by Brookfield Properties. The mall's anchors now include Macy's, Boscov's, JC Penney, and Dick's Sporting Goods. Two anchor spaces are currently vacant following the December 2019 closure of Lord and Taylor (120,000 SF) and the April 2020 closure of Sears (274,100 SF). Macy's, JC Penny and the former Lord & Taylor space are not included as collateral for the loan. Other major tenants include Boscov's, Dick's Sporting Goods and Dave & Busters. As of December 2020, the collateral was 69% leased, compared to overall 97% in December 2019 and 97% at securitization. The inline occupancy was 88% as of June 2020, compared to 85% in March 2019. Property performance had declined annually since 2015 and the 2019 net operating income (NOI) was nearly 17% lower than in 2014 with a 2019 NOI DSCR of 1.19X. Property performance further decline in 2020 with the 2020 NOI declining an additional 18% year over year and causing the NOI DSCR to decline below 1.00X. The property was closed temporarily during the coronavirus pandemic and re-opened in June. The loan transferred to special servicing in June 2020 for imminent monetary default stemming from the impacts of the pandemic and the property's decline in performance. Furthermore, the property also faces significant competition with seven competitive regional and super regional centers located within a 20 miles radius of the property. The loan is last paid through its April 2020 payment date and the special servicer indicated they are dual tracking ligation options while continuing discussions with the borrower. The loan has amortized 6.2% since securitization after an initial 3 year interest only period, however, the property was recently appraised at a value significantly below the outstanding loan balance and the master servicer subsequently recognized an appraisal reduction of nearly 63% of the outstanding loan amount. As a result of the appraisal reduction interest shortfalls significantly increased as of the March 2021 remittance date.The second largest specially serviced loan is the Montgomery Mall Loan ($54.0 million -- 7.1% of the pool), which represents a pari-passu portion of a $100 million first mortgage loan. The loan is secured by an approximately 580,000 SF component of a 1.1 million SF regional mall in North Wales, Pennsylvania, a northern suburb of Philadelphia. The property is currently anchored by Macy's, JC Penney, Wegmans, and Dick's Sporting Goods. One anchor space (169,000 SF) is now vacant following the February 2020 closure of Sears. As of December 2019, the total mall and the inline space were 87% (reducing to 71% after Sears vacancy) and 72% occupied, respectively, compared to 92% and 67% as of December 2018. Property performance had deteriorated since 2016 and the year-end 2019 NOI was approximately 26% lower than in 2014. While the property benefits from an infill location 20 miles northwest of Philadelphia, competition exists from six competitive regional and super regional centers located within a 20 miles radius of the property. The property was temporarily closed from March 14th to June 26th as a result of the pandemic and the loan transferred to special servicing in June 2020 for imminent default. The loan is last paid through its December 2020 payment date and special servicer commentary indicates the sponsor, Simon Property Group, is unwilling to inject additional funds into loan but is continuing to manage property and a cash lockbox has been implemented. The property was appraised in August 2020 at a value below the outstanding loan balance and as of the March 2021 remittance report the master servicer has recognized an appraisal reduction of approximately 49% of the outstanding loan amount.The third largest specially serviced loan is the Weatherford Ridge loan ($29.1 million -- 3.8% of the pool), which is secured by a power center located in Weatherford, Texas, approximately 25 miles west of downtown Fort Worth and positioned at the intersection of I-20 and Main Street. The property was 94% leased as of June 2020. Tenants at the property consist of a mix of national retailers, including Belk, TJ Maxx, Bed Bath & Beyond, and Michaels. A non-collateral JC Penney serves as a shadow anchor at the property and this location has not appeared on any store closing lists. Bed, Bath & Beyond has a co-tenancy provision related to JC Penney going dark. The loan transferred to special servicing in July 2020 per the borrower's request and the loan was over 60 days delinquent. The special servicer indicated they are actively discussing a potential loan modification. The loan is last paid through its April 2020 payment date.The remaining five specially serviced loans are primarily secured by retail and hotel properties, including the Oak Court Mall (1.9% of the pool) which has also exhibited significant declines in performance and was appraised in July 2020 significantly below its loan balance. All of the remaining specially serviced loans were more than 90 days delinquent.As of the March 2021 remittance statement cumulative interest shortfalls were $2.6 million and impact up to Cl. C. Moody's anticipates interest shortfalls will continue because of the significant exposure to specially serviced loans. Interest shortfalls are caused by special servicing fees, including workout and liquidation fees, appraisal entitlement reductions (ASERs), loan modifications and extraordinary trust expenses.Moody's has also assumed a high default probability for two poorly performing loans secured by hotel properties, constituting 2.5% of the pool. The largest troubled loan is the Hampton Inn Hallandale (2.0% of the pool) which had already experienced declining revenue and NOI through year-end 2019. Moody's has estimated an aggregate loss of $124.2 million (a 51% expected loss on average) from these specially serviced and troubled loans.The credit risk of loans is determined primarily by two factors: 1) Moody's assessment of the probability of default, which is largely driven by each loan's DSCR, and 2) Moody's assessment of the severity of loss upon a default, which is largely driven by each loan's loan-to-value ratio, referred to as the Moody's LTV or MLTV. As described in the CMBS methodology used to rate this transaction, we make various adjustments to the MLTV. We adjust the MLTV for each loan using a value that reflects capitalization (cap) rates that are between our sustainable cap rates and market cap rates. We also use an adjusted loan balance that reflects each loan's amortization profile. The MLTV reported in this publication reflects the MLTV before the adjustments described in the methodology.Moody's received full year 2019 operating results for 89% of the pool, and full or partial year 2020 operating results for 94% of the pool (excluding specially serviced and defeased loans). Moody's weighted average conduit LTV is 92%, compared to 94% at Moody's last review. Moody's conduit component excludes loans with structured credit assessments, defeased and CTL loans, and specially serviced and troubled loans. Moody's net cash flow (NCF) reflects a weighted average haircut of 14% to the most recently available net operating income (NOI). Moody's value reflects a weighted average capitalization rate of 9.8%.Moody's actual and stressed conduit DSCRs are 1.65X and 1.23X, respectively, compared to 1.64X and 1.21X at the last review. Moody's actual DSCR is based on Moody's NCF and the loan's actual debt service. Moody's stressed DSCR is based on Moody's NCF and a 9.25% stress rate the agency applied to the loan balance.The top three conduit loans represent 14.1% of the pool balance. The largest loan is the Pacific Design Center Loan ($48.6 million -- 6.4% of the pool), which represents a pari-passu portion of a $140.9 million first mortgage loan. The property is also encumbered with $20 million of mezzanine debt. The loan is secured by a 1.0 million SF component of a 1.4 million SF mixed-use facility containing design and office space located in West Hollywood, California. The property is comprised of three buildings known as the Blue Building, the Green Building and the Red Building, due to their respectively colored glass exteriors. The Blue Building, almost fully comprised of design showroom space, consists of a 717,914 SF, 6-story structure constructed in 1976. The Green Building consists of a 385,088 SF, 9-story office (278,813 SF) and showroom facility (106,275 SF) constructed in 1988. The Red Building consists of a 420,000 SF office building constructed in 2012. Only the Blue Building and Green Building are contributed as collateral for the loan. In addition to the showroom and office space, the property also features a private branch of the Los Angeles Museum of Contemporary Art, a fitness center, a 388-seat theater, a 1,900 space sub-grade parking garage, as well as several public spaces, atriums and courtyards. As of September 2020, the collateral was 68% leased, compared to 66% leased in March 2019 and 55% in March 2018. Occupancy fell in 2017 following various affiliates of the Interpublic Group of Companies vacating their space. Property performance rebounded since 2018 and the year to date September 2020 NOI DSCR was 1.55X. The loan remained current as of the March 2021 remittance date and has amortized almost 3% since securitization after an initial interest only period. The Moody's LTV and stressed DSCR are 116% and 0.93X, respectively, compared to 117% and 0.92X at the last review.The second largest loan is the Purgatory Creek Apartments Loan ($30.8 million -- 4.0% of the pool), which is secured by a multifamily property located in San Marcos, Texas, approximately 28 miles south of the Austin CBD and two miles from Texas State University. Common area amenities include a two-tier resort style pool with spa and steam room/sauna, 24-hour fitness center, clubhouse with full kitchen and bar area, business center, and a laundry room in every building. As of December 2020, the property was 91% leased, compared to 90% leased as of December 2019. The year-end 2020 NOI increased slightly from 2019 as a result of increased revenue. The loan has amortized almost 3% since securitization and Moody's LTV and stressed DSCR are 113% and 0.81X, respectively, compared to 118% and 0.78X at the last review.The third largest loan is the Harlequin Plaza Loan ($28.0 million -- 3.7% of the pool), which is secured by two adjacent Class-B office buildings located in Greenwood Village, Colorado, approximately 14 miles southeast of the Denver CBD. The buildings, built in 1980 and renovated in 2013, are three and four stories tall. Property performance declined in 2019 as a result of lower revenue and occupancy, but rebounded in 2020. The property was 93% occupied as of September 2020, up from 83% in December 2018. The property's three largest tenants represent an aggregate 52% of the property's square footage and do not have lease expirations prior to December 2022. The loan is interest only for its entire term and Moody's LTV and stressed DSCR are 97% and 1.08X, respectively, compared to 98% and 1.07X at the last review.REGULATORY DISCLOSURESFor further specification of Moody's key rating assumptions and sensitivity analysis, see the sections Methodology Assumptions and Sensitivity to Assumptions in the disclosure form.

2021-03-29T16:44:58.000Z,Is Bed Bath and Beyond (BBBY) A Smart Long-Term Buy?,"L1 Capital, an independent investment management firm, published its fourth quarter 2020 “L1 Long Short Fund Limited” investor letter – a copy of which can be downloaded here. The Company’s NTA increased 34.4% for the quarter (ASX200AI +13.7%) and 29.5% for the 2020 calendar year (ASX200AI 1.4%). You can view the fund’s top 5 holdings to have a peek at their top bets for 2021. L1 Capital, in their Q4 2020 investor letter, mentioned Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. (NASDAQ: BBBY) and emphasized their views on the company. Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. is a Union, New Jersey-based retail-store company that currently has a $3.5 billion market capitalization. Since the beginning of the year, BBBY delivered a 64.75% return, impressively extending its 12-month gains to 529.25%. As of March 26, 2021, the stock closed at $29.26 per share. Here is what L1 Capital has to say about Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. in their Q4 2020 investor letter: ""Bed Bath & Beyond (BBBY) (long +19%) is a major U.S. retailer that has been struggling from many years of mismanagement, poor capital allocation and a lacklustre customer experience. Mark Tritton (a fellow Australian) was appointed CEO in November 2019 and has spent the past year replacing senior management with a proven team of high calibre executives that are now set to overhaul all aspects of the business. Tritton is an exceptional retail executive who had been instrumental in the turnaround of Target U.S. (he was the Head of Merchandising). At the time we bought in to BBBY in July 2020, the company was widely expected to go bankrupt. Short interest was an astounding 60%, almost every sell-side analyst rated the stock a “sell” or “neutral”, and the shares had already fallen from US$75 in 2015 to less than US$5 by March 2020. We believed the shares had enormous upside even if the new management team only delivered on their initial cost out targets and non-core asset sales. BBBY has since been a very strong performer for the portfolio with the new management team demonstrating early signs of success on the turnaround program and the share price almost doubling from our initial entry price of around US$9.20. At its strategy day in October 2020, BBBY announced a target of delivering ~US$850-$1,000m EBITDA in 2023 which remains well above current consensus forecasts of ~US$650m indicating the level of scepticism that remains in the market. Despite the rally in the shares, we continue to see large upside in the stock as management execute on numerous areas of low hanging fruit such as better product sourcing, higher quality private label products, more efficient supply chain, closing loss-making stores, cutting head office costs, selling non-core assets, etc. BBBY sold its last non-core asset in mid-December (Cost Plus World Market) and announced a US$150m share repurchase concurrent with the sale. We expect management will flag further large scale buybacks going forward that will demonstrate both balance sheet strength and management’s optimism in the future of the business.""

2021-03-25T20:03:06.000Z,Wells Fargo Commercial Mortgage Trust 2017-C40 -- Moody's affirms seven classes of WFCM 2017-C40,"Rating Action: Moody's affirms seven classes of WFCM 2017-C40Global Credit Research - 25 Mar 2021Approximately $508.2 million of structured securities affectedNew York, March 25, 2021 -- Moody's Investors Service, (""Moody's"") has affirmed the ratings on seven classes in Wells Fargo Commercial Mortgage Trust 2017-C40 as follows:Cl. A-1, Affirmed Aaa (sf); previously on Oct 12, 2018 Affirmed Aaa (sf)Cl. A-2, Affirmed Aaa (sf); previously on Oct 12, 2018 Affirmed Aaa (sf)Cl. A-3, Affirmed Aaa (sf); previously on Oct 12, 2018 Affirmed Aaa (sf)Cl. A-4, Affirmed Aaa (sf); previously on Oct 12, 2018 Affirmed Aaa (sf)Cl.

X-A*, Affirmed Aaa (sf); previously on Oct 12, 2018 Affirmed Aaa (sf)* Reflects interest-only classesRATINGS RATIONALEThe ratings on the P&I classes were affirmed because the transaction's key metrics, including Moody's loan-to-value (LTV) ratio, Moody's stressed debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) and the transaction's Herfindahl Index (Herf), are within acceptable ranges.The rating on the IO class, Cl. X-A was affirmed based on the credit quality of the referenced classes.The coronavirus pandemic has had a significant impact on economic activity. Although global economies have shown a remarkable degree of resilience to date and are returning to growth, the uneven effects on individual businesses, sectors and regions will continue throughout 2021 and will endure as a challenge to the world's economies well beyond the end of the year. While persistent virus fears remain the main risk for a recovery in demand, the economy will recover faster if vaccines and further fiscal and monetary policy responses bring forward a normalization of activity. As a result, there is a heightened degree of uncertainty around our forecasts. Our analysis has considered the effect on the performance of commercial real estate from a gradual and unbalanced recovery in US economic activity. Stress on commercial real estate properties will be most directly stemming from declines in hotel occupancies (particularly related to conference or other group attendance) and declines in foot traffic and sales for non-essential items at retail properties.We regard the coronavirus outbreak as a social risk under our ESG framework, given the substantial implications for public health and safety.Moody's rating action reflects a base expected loss of 7.2% of the current pooled balance, compared to 4.6% at Moody's last review. Moody's base expected loss plus realized losses is now 7.0% of the original pooled balance, compared to 4.6% at the last review. Moody's provides a current list of base expected losses for conduit and fusion CMBS transactions on moodys.com at http://www.moodys.com/viewresearchdoc.aspx?docid=PBS_SF215255.FACTORS THAT WOULD LEAD TO AN UPGRADE OR DOWNGRADE OF THE RATINGSThe performance expectations for a given variable indicate Moody's forward-looking view of the likely range of performance over the medium term. Performance that falls outside the given range can indicate that the collateral's credit quality is stronger or weaker than Moody's had previously expected.Factors that could lead to an upgrade of the ratings include a significant amount of loan paydowns or amortization, an increase in the pool's share of defeasance or an improvement in pool performance.Factors that could lead to a downgrade of the ratings include a decline in the performance of the pool, loan concentration, an increase in realized and expected losses from specially serviced and troubled loans or interest shortfalls.METHODOLOGY UNDERLYING THE RATING ACTIONThe principal methodology used in rating all classes except interest-only classes was ""Approach to Rating US and Canadian Conduit/Fusion CMBS"" published in September 2020 and available at https://www.moodys.com/researchdocumentcontentpage.aspx?docid=PBS_1244778. The methodologies used in rating interest-only classes were ""Approach to Rating US and Canadian Conduit/Fusion CMBS"" published in September 2020 and available at https://www.moodys.com/researchdocumentcontentpage.aspx?docid=PBS_1244778 and ""Moody's Approach to Rating Structured Finance Interest-Only (IO) Securities"" published in February 2019 and available at https://www.moodys.com/researchdocumentcontentpage.aspx?docid=PBS_1111179. Please see the list of ratings at the top of this announcement to identify which classes are interest-only (indicated by the *). Alternatively, please see the Rating Methodologies page on www.moodys.com for a copy of these methodologies. DEAL PERFORMANCEAs of the March 17, 2021 distribution date, the transaction's aggregate certificate balance has decreased by 3% to $687.5 million from $705.4 million at securitization. The certificates are collateralized by 65 mortgage loans ranging in size from less than 1% to 9% of the pool, with the top ten loans (excluding defeasance) constituting 50% of the pool. One loan, constituting 4% of the pool, has an investment-grade structured credit assessment.Moody's uses a variation of Herf to measure the diversity of loan sizes, where a higher number represents greater diversity. Loan concentration has an important bearing on potential rating volatility, including the risk of multiple notch downgrades under adverse circumstances. The credit neutral Herf score is 40. The pool has a Herf of 28, compared to a Herf of 29 at Moody's last review.As of the March 2021 remittance report, loans representing 90% were current or within their grace period on their debt service payments, 5% were beyond their grace period but less than 30 days delinquent and 2% were between 60+ days delinquent.Seventeen loans, constituting 18% of the pool, are on the master servicer's watchlist, of which one loan, representing 2% of the pool, indicate the borrower has requested relief in relation to coronavirus impact on the property. The watchlist includes loans that meet certain portfolio review guidelines established as part of the CRE Finance Council (CREFC) monthly reporting package. As part of Moody's ongoing monitoring of a transaction, the agency reviews the watchlist to assess which loans have material issues that could affect performance.Four loans, constituting 10% of the pool, are currently in special servicing. All the specially serviced loans have transferred to special servicing since March 2020.The largest specially serviced loan is the SAVA Holdings IHG Portfolio Loan ($36.2 million -- 5.3% of the pool), which is secured by the fee simple interest in three limited-service hotels totaling 429 keys located across Fort Worth and Plano, Texas. The collateral includes the 174-key Candlewood Suites DFW South, the 143-key Holiday Inn DFW South and the 112-key Staybridge Suites Plano. Each of the properties have franchise agreements that extend into 2032. The Candlewood Suites DFW South accommodates training programs for American Airlines, and 100 of the 174 rooms (57%) have been under contract by American Airlines Group since the hotel's opening. As of December 2019, the portfolio's net operating income (NOI) was 28% below the underwritten NOI and has continued to decline in 2020 as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. The loan transferred to special servicing in April 2020 due to the delinquent payments as a result to disruptions in relation to the coronavirus pandemic. In November 2020 the special servicer had approved a six-month forbearance agreement with the borrower. The loan has amortized 2.1% since securitization and is less than one-month delinquent on its March 2021 payment date.The second largest specially serviced loan is the Hilton Garden Inn Chicago/North Loop Loan ($18.2 million -- 2.6% of the pool), which represents a pari-passu portion of a $30.1 million mortgage loan. The loan is secured by a 191 key full-service hotel located in the CBD of Chicago, Illinois. Through year-end 2019 the property's performance had improved from securitization due to an increase in revenue and the 2019 NOI DSCR was 1.89X. However, as a result of the pandemic, the property temporarily closed in late March through April 2020, reopened in May and has closed again in December 2020. The hotel typically caters to corporate business travel and the property's operations have been significantly impacted by the recent lack of business travel. The loan transferred to special servicing in April 2020 due to imminent monetary default and is last paid through June 2020. The trust counsel has started the foreclosure process.The third largest specially serviced loan is the League City Hotel Portfolio Loan ($10.4 million -- 1.5% of the pool), which is secured by a portfolio of two limited-service hotels totaling 164 keys located in League City, Texas, approximately 25-miles southeast of Houston. The collateral includes an 81-key Hampton Inn & Suites Houston/League City and an 83-key Candlewood Suites League City hotel. The portfolio's NOI was up 18% as of December 2018 when compared to the underwritten NOI, however significantly declined in 2019 and Q1 2020 as both properties were undergoing PIP renovations. The loan transferred to special servicing in April 2020 due to imminent monetary default and is last paid through December 2020. In June 2020, the special servicer had approved a twelve-month forbearance agreement with the borrower however, in November the borrower failed to comply with terms of the agreement and has since requested a more expansive loan modification. The loan has amortized 4.9% since securitization and is last paid through December 2020.The remaining specially serviced loan is secured by a self-storage property located in Melbourne, Florida and makes up less than 1% of the pool.Moody's has also assumed a high default probability for five poorly performing loans, constituting 5% of the pool, and has estimated an aggregate loss of $20.9 million (an 21% expected loss) from these specially serviced and troubled loans.The credit risk of loans is determined primarily by two factors: 1) Moody's assessment of the probability of default, which is largely driven by each loan's DSCR, and 2) Moody's assessment of the severity of loss upon a default, which is largely driven by each loan's loan-to-value ratio, referred to as the Moody's LTV or MLTV. As described in the CMBS methodology used to rate this transaction, we make various adjustments to the MLTV. We adjust the MLTV for each loan using a value that reflects capitalization (cap) rates that are between our sustainable cap rates and market cap rates. We also use an adjusted loan balance that reflects each loan's amortization profile. The MLTV reported in this publication reflects the MLTV before the adjustments described in the methodology.Moody's received full year 2019 operating results for 95% of the pool, and full or partial year 2020 operating results for 82% of the pool (excluding specially serviced and defeased loans). Moody's weighted average conduit LTV is 108%, compared to 109% at Moody's last review. Moody's conduit component excludes loans with structured credit assessments, defeased and CTL loans, and specially serviced and troubled loans. Moody's net cash flow (NCF) reflects a weighted average haircut of 17% to the most recently available net operating income (NOI). Moody's value reflects a weighted average capitalization rate of 9.7%.Moody's actual and stressed conduit DSCRs are 1.88X and 1.00X, respectively, compared to 1.82X and 0.99X at the last review. Moody's actual DSCR is based on Moody's NCF and the loan's actual debt service. Moody's stressed DSCR is based on Moody's NCF and a 9.25% stress rate the agency applied to the loan balance.The loan with a structured credit assessment is the Del Amo Fashion Center Loan ($25.0 million -- 3.6% of the pool), which represents a pari-passu portion of a $459.3 senior mortgage. The property is also encumbered by $125.7 million in subordinate debt. The loan is secured by a 1.8 million square foot (SF) component of a 2.5 million SF super-regional mall located in Torrance, California. Since 2014, the sponsor has completed a $423.0 million renovation encompassing all three of the property's interconnected components. The property is anchored by Sears (non-collateral), Macy's (non-collateral), J.C. Penney, Nordstrom, and AMC Theatres. Other major tenants include Dick's Sporting Goods, Burlington Coat Factory, LA Fitness, Dave & Busters, and Marshalls. The property was 87% leased as of December 2020. As of December 2020, collateral occupancy, inline occupancy, and total mall occupancy were 82%, 71% and 87%, respectively. Year-end comparable in-line tenant sales were reported as $577 PSF for 2019, compared to $573 PSF in 2018. Moody's structured credit assessment and stressed DSCR are baa2 (sca.pd) and 1.20X, respectively.The top three conduit loans represent 22% of the pool balance. The largest loan is the 225 & 233 Park Avenue South Loan ($60.0 million -- 8.7% of the pool), which represents a pari-passu portion of a $235.0 million senior mortgage loan secured by two interconnected, Class A office buildings, totaling 675,756 SF, located in New York, New York. The property is also encumbered by $195 million in subordinate debt. The properties are located one block north of Union Square and occupy the entire block between East 18th and East 19th Streets on Park Avenue South. Major tenants at the property include Facebook (39% of the NRA; lease expiration October 2027), Buzzfeed (29%; lease expiration May 2026), and STV, Inc. (20%; lease expiration May 2024) with Facebook and Buzzfeed having invested $60.0 million ($225/sf) and $23.9 million ($123/sf), respectively, of their own money into their spaces. The properties were 99% leased as of August 2020, compared to 98% in March 2018 and at securitization. The 2019 NOI has declined from underwritten levels as the increase in expenses has outweighed the increased revenues. The higher expenses were largely due to higher taxes and general and administrative expenses. The loan is interest-only through its entire term and Moody's LTV and stressed DSCR are 80% and 1.12X, respectively, the same as at the last reviewThe second largest loan is the Mall of Louisiana Loan ($49.5 million -- 7.2% of the pool), which represents a pari-passu portion of a $321.7 million mortgage loan. The loan is secured by a 776,789 SF portion of a 1,593,545 SF enclosed, two-story super-regional mall located in Baton Rouge, Louisiana and sponsored by Brookfield Properties Retail Group. The property is located approximately six miles from downtown Baton Rouge. The mall's anchors are Dillard's, Macy's, J.C. Penney and Sears, all of which are non-collateral. Additional large retailers at the property include AMC Theaters, Dick's Sporting Goods, and Nordstrom Rack. In 2008, a $100 million expansion occurred that added over 330,000 SF, which included a 125,000 SF lifestyle component, a 140,000 SF power center, and the 15-screen movie theater (65,000 SF) currently occupied by AMC Theatres. The property includes an adjacent lifestyle center attached to the main, two-level enclosed super-regional mall. Notable tenants include Apple and Versona. As of September 2020, the collateral was 89% occupied compared to 93% as of December 2019. Moody's LTV and stressed DSCR are 125% and 0.84X, respectively, compared to 102% and 0.98X at last review.The third largest loan is the Marketplace at Millcreek Loan ($39.6 million -- 5.8% of the pool), which is secured by the fee simple interest in a 401,947 SF, open-air retail center in Buford, Georgia, immediately adjacent to the Mall of Georgia. The largest tenant at the property, Burlington Coat Factory (50,000 SF, 12.4% of NRA) took over the previous Toys R Us space in 2018 with a lease expiration in May 2022. Additional tenants at the property include Bed Bath & Beyond (33,889 SF, 8.4% of NRA), Ross (30,093 SF, 7.5% of NRA), Marshall's (30,000 SF, 7.5% of NRA). In April 2020, Painted Tree Marketplace (30,000 SF, 7.5% of NRA) backfilled the former Stein Mart space. As of September 2020, the property occupancy and DSCR NOI were 99% and 3.58x. The loan is interest-only through its entire term. Moody's LTV and stressed DSCR are 89% and 1.10X, respectively, the same as at the last review.REGULATORY DISCLOSURESFor further specification of Moody's key rating assumptions and sensitivity analysis, see the sections Methodology Assumptions and Sensitivity to Assumptions in the disclosure form.

2021-03-25T19:52:06.000Z,Wells Fargo Comm Mtg Tr 2017-C40 -- Moody's affirms seven classes of WFCM 2017-C40,"Rating Action: Moody's affirms seven classes of WFCM 2017-C40Global Credit Research - 25 Mar 2021Approximately $508.2 million of structured securities affectedNew York, March 25, 2021 -- Moody's Investors Service, (""Moody's"") has affirmed the ratings on seven classes in Wells Fargo Commercial Mortgage Trust 2017-C40 as follows:Cl. A-1, Affirmed Aaa (sf); previously on Oct 12, 2018 Affirmed Aaa (sf)Cl. A-2, Affirmed Aaa (sf); previously on Oct 12, 2018 Affirmed Aaa (sf)Cl. A-3, Affirmed Aaa (sf); previously on Oct 12, 2018 Affirmed Aaa (sf)Cl. A-4, Affirmed Aaa (sf); previously on Oct 12, 2018 Affirmed Aaa (sf)Cl.

X-A*, Affirmed Aaa (sf); previously on Oct 12, 2018 Affirmed Aaa (sf)* Reflects interest-only classesRATINGS RATIONALEThe ratings on the P&I classes were affirmed because the transaction's key metrics, including Moody's loan-to-value (LTV) ratio, Moody's stressed debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) and the transaction's Herfindahl Index (Herf), are within acceptable ranges.The rating on the IO class, Cl. X-A was affirmed based on the credit quality of the referenced classes.The coronavirus pandemic has had a significant impact on economic activity. Although global economies have shown a remarkable degree of resilience to date and are returning to growth, the uneven effects on individual businesses, sectors and regions will continue throughout 2021 and will endure as a challenge to the world's economies well beyond the end of the year. While persistent virus fears remain the main risk for a recovery in demand, the economy will recover faster if vaccines and further fiscal and monetary policy responses bring forward a normalization of activity. As a result, there is a heightened degree of uncertainty around our forecasts. Our analysis has considered the effect on the performance of commercial real estate from a gradual and unbalanced recovery in US economic activity. Stress on commercial real estate properties will be most directly stemming from declines in hotel occupancies (particularly related to conference or other group attendance) and declines in foot traffic and sales for non-essential items at retail properties.We regard the coronavirus outbreak as a social risk under our ESG framework, given the substantial implications for public health and safety.Moody's rating action reflects a base expected loss of 7.2% of the current pooled balance, compared to 4.6% at Moody's last review. Moody's base expected loss plus realized losses is now 7.0% of the original pooled balance, compared to 4.6% at the last review. Moody's provides a current list of base expected losses for conduit and fusion CMBS transactions on moodys.com at http://www.moodys.com/viewresearchdoc.aspx?docid=PBS_SF215255.FACTORS THAT WOULD LEAD TO AN UPGRADE OR DOWNGRADE OF THE RATINGSThe performance expectations for a given variable indicate Moody's forward-looking view of the likely range of performance over the medium term. Performance that falls outside the given range can indicate that the collateral's credit quality is stronger or weaker than Moody's had previously expected.Factors that could lead to an upgrade of the ratings include a significant amount of loan paydowns or amortization, an increase in the pool's share of defeasance or an improvement in pool performance.Factors that could lead to a downgrade of the ratings include a decline in the performance of the pool, loan concentration, an increase in realized and expected losses from specially serviced and troubled loans or interest shortfalls.METHODOLOGY UNDERLYING THE RATING ACTIONThe principal methodology used in rating all classes except interest-only classes was ""Approach to Rating US and Canadian Conduit/Fusion CMBS"" published in September 2020 and available at https://www.moodys.com/researchdocumentcontentpage.aspx?docid=PBS_1244778. The methodologies used in rating interest-only classes were ""Approach to Rating US and Canadian Conduit/Fusion CMBS"" published in September 2020 and available at https://www.moodys.com/researchdocumentcontentpage.aspx?docid=PBS_1244778 and ""Moody's Approach to Rating Structured Finance Interest-Only (IO) Securities"" published in February 2019 and available at https://www.moodys.com/researchdocumentcontentpage.aspx?docid=PBS_1111179. Please see the list of ratings at the top of this announcement to identify which classes are interest-only (indicated by the *). Alternatively, please see the Rating Methodologies page on www.moodys.com for a copy of these methodologies. DEAL PERFORMANCEAs of the March 17, 2021 distribution date, the transaction's aggregate certificate balance has decreased by 3% to $687.5 million from $705.4 million at securitization. The certificates are collateralized by 65 mortgage loans ranging in size from less than 1% to 9% of the pool, with the top ten loans (excluding defeasance) constituting 50% of the pool. One loan, constituting 4% of the pool, has an investment-grade structured credit assessment.Moody's uses a variation of Herf to measure the diversity of loan sizes, where a higher number represents greater diversity. Loan concentration has an important bearing on potential rating volatility, including the risk of multiple notch downgrades under adverse circumstances. The credit neutral Herf score is 40. The pool has a Herf of 28, compared to a Herf of 29 at Moody's last review.As of the March 2021 remittance report, loans representing 90% were current or within their grace period on their debt service payments, 5% were beyond their grace period but less than 30 days delinquent and 2% were between 60+ days delinquent.Seventeen loans, constituting 18% of the pool, are on the master servicer's watchlist, of which one loan, representing 2% of the pool, indicate the borrower has requested relief in relation to coronavirus impact on the property. The watchlist includes loans that meet certain portfolio review guidelines established as part of the CRE Finance Council (CREFC) monthly reporting package. As part of Moody's ongoing monitoring of a transaction, the agency reviews the watchlist to assess which loans have material issues that could affect performance.Four loans, constituting 10% of the pool, are currently in special servicing. All the specially serviced loans have transferred to special servicing since March 2020.The largest specially serviced loan is the SAVA Holdings IHG Portfolio Loan ($36.2 million -- 5.3% of the pool), which is secured by the fee simple interest in three limited-service hotels totaling 429 keys located across Fort Worth and Plano, Texas. The collateral includes the 174-key Candlewood Suites DFW South, the 143-key Holiday Inn DFW South and the 112-key Staybridge Suites Plano. Each of the properties have franchise agreements that extend into 2032. The Candlewood Suites DFW South accommodates training programs for American Airlines, and 100 of the 174 rooms (57%) have been under contract by American Airlines Group since the hotel's opening. As of December 2019, the portfolio's net operating income (NOI) was 28% below the underwritten NOI and has continued to decline in 2020 as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. The loan transferred to special servicing in April 2020 due to the delinquent payments as a result to disruptions in relation to the coronavirus pandemic. In November 2020 the special servicer had approved a six-month forbearance agreement with the borrower. The loan has amortized 2.1% since securitization and is less than one-month delinquent on its March 2021 payment date.The second largest specially serviced loan is the Hilton Garden Inn Chicago/North Loop Loan ($18.2 million -- 2.6% of the pool), which represents a pari-passu portion of a $30.1 million mortgage loan. The loan is secured by a 191 key full-service hotel located in the CBD of Chicago, Illinois. Through year-end 2019 the property's performance had improved from securitization due to an increase in revenue and the 2019 NOI DSCR was 1.89X. However, as a result of the pandemic, the property temporarily closed in late March through April 2020, reopened in May and has closed again in December 2020. The hotel typically caters to corporate business travel and the property's operations have been significantly impacted by the recent lack of business travel. The loan transferred to special servicing in April 2020 due to imminent monetary default and is last paid through June 2020. The trust counsel has started the foreclosure process.The third largest specially serviced loan is the League City Hotel Portfolio Loan ($10.4 million -- 1.5% of the pool), which is secured by a portfolio of two limited-service hotels totaling 164 keys located in League City, Texas, approximately 25-miles southeast of Houston. The collateral includes an 81-key Hampton Inn & Suites Houston/League City and an 83-key Candlewood Suites League City hotel. The portfolio's NOI was up 18% as of December 2018 when compared to the underwritten NOI, however significantly declined in 2019 and Q1 2020 as both properties were undergoing PIP renovations. The loan transferred to special servicing in April 2020 due to imminent monetary default and is last paid through December 2020. In June 2020, the special servicer had approved a twelve-month forbearance agreement with the borrower however, in November the borrower failed to comply with terms of the agreement and has since requested a more expansive loan modification. The loan has amortized 4.9% since securitization and is last paid through December 2020.The remaining specially serviced loan is secured by a self-storage property located in Melbourne, Florida and makes up less than 1% of the pool.Moody's has also assumed a high default probability for five poorly performing loans, constituting 5% of the pool, and has estimated an aggregate loss of $20.9 million (an 21% expected loss) from these specially serviced and troubled loans.The credit risk of loans is determined primarily by two factors: 1) Moody's assessment of the probability of default, which is largely driven by each loan's DSCR, and 2) Moody's assessment of the severity of loss upon a default, which is largely driven by each loan's loan-to-value ratio, referred to as the Moody's LTV or MLTV. As described in the CMBS methodology used to rate this transaction, we make various adjustments to the MLTV. We adjust the MLTV for each loan using a value that reflects capitalization (cap) rates that are between our sustainable cap rates and market cap rates. We also use an adjusted loan balance that reflects each loan's amortization profile. The MLTV reported in this publication reflects the MLTV before the adjustments described in the methodology.Moody's received full year 2019 operating results for 95% of the pool, and full or partial year 2020 operating results for 82% of the pool (excluding specially serviced and defeased loans). Moody's weighted average conduit LTV is 108%, compared to 109% at Moody's last review. Moody's conduit component excludes loans with structured credit assessments, defeased and CTL loans, and specially serviced and troubled loans. Moody's net cash flow (NCF) reflects a weighted average haircut of 17% to the most recently available net operating income (NOI). Moody's value reflects a weighted average capitalization rate of 9.7%.Moody's actual and stressed conduit DSCRs are 1.88X and 1.00X, respectively, compared to 1.82X and 0.99X at the last review. Moody's actual DSCR is based on Moody's NCF and the loan's actual debt service. Moody's stressed DSCR is based on Moody's NCF and a 9.25% stress rate the agency applied to the loan balance.The loan with a structured credit assessment is the Del Amo Fashion Center Loan ($25.0 million -- 3.6% of the pool), which represents a pari-passu portion of a $459.3 senior mortgage. The property is also encumbered by $125.7 million in subordinate debt. The loan is secured by a 1.8 million square foot (SF) component of a 2.5 million SF super-regional mall located in Torrance, California. Since 2014, the sponsor has completed a $423.0 million renovation encompassing all three of the property's interconnected components. The property is anchored by Sears (non-collateral), Macy's (non-collateral), J.C. Penney, Nordstrom, and AMC Theatres. Other major tenants include Dick's Sporting Goods, Burlington Coat Factory, LA Fitness, Dave & Busters, and Marshalls. The property was 87% leased as of December 2020. As of December 2020, collateral occupancy, inline occupancy, and total mall occupancy were 82%, 71% and 87%, respectively. Year-end comparable in-line tenant sales were reported as $577 PSF for 2019, compared to $573 PSF in 2018. Moody's structured credit assessment and stressed DSCR are baa2 (sca.pd) and 1.20X, respectively.The top three conduit loans represent 22% of the pool balance. The largest loan is the 225 & 233 Park Avenue South Loan ($60.0 million -- 8.7% of the pool), which represents a pari-passu portion of a $235.0 million senior mortgage loan secured by two interconnected, Class A office buildings, totaling 675,756 SF, located in New York, New York. The property is also encumbered by $195 million in subordinate debt. The properties are located one block north of Union Square and occupy the entire block between East 18th and East 19th Streets on Park Avenue South. Major tenants at the property include Facebook (39% of the NRA; lease expiration October 2027), Buzzfeed (29%; lease expiration May 2026), and STV, Inc. (20%; lease expiration May 2024) with Facebook and Buzzfeed having invested $60.0 million ($225/sf) and $23.9 million ($123/sf), respectively, of their own money into their spaces. The properties were 99% leased as of August 2020, compared to 98% in March 2018 and at securitization. The 2019 NOI has declined from underwritten levels as the increase in expenses has outweighed the increased revenues. The higher expenses were largely due to higher taxes and general and administrative expenses. The loan is interest-only through its entire term and Moody's LTV and stressed DSCR are 80% and 1.12X, respectively, the same as at the last reviewThe second largest loan is the Mall of Louisiana Loan ($49.5 million -- 7.2% of the pool), which represents a pari-passu portion of a $321.7 million mortgage loan. The loan is secured by a 776,789 SF portion of a 1,593,545 SF enclosed, two-story super-regional mall located in Baton Rouge, Louisiana and sponsored by Brookfield Properties Retail Group. The property is located approximately six miles from downtown Baton Rouge. The mall's anchors are Dillard's, Macy's, J.C. Penney and Sears, all of which are non-collateral. Additional large retailers at the property include AMC Theaters, Dick's Sporting Goods, and Nordstrom Rack. In 2008, a $100 million expansion occurred that added over 330,000 SF, which included a 125,000 SF lifestyle component, a 140,000 SF power center, and the 15-screen movie theater (65,000 SF) currently occupied by AMC Theatres. The property includes an adjacent lifestyle center attached to the main, two-level enclosed super-regional mall. Notable tenants include Apple and Versona. As of September 2020, the collateral was 89% occupied compared to 93% as of December 2019. Moody's LTV and stressed DSCR are 125% and 0.84X, respectively, compared to 102% and 0.98X at last review.The third largest loan is the Marketplace at Millcreek Loan ($39.6 million -- 5.8% of the pool), which is secured by the fee simple interest in a 401,947 SF, open-air retail center in Buford, Georgia, immediately adjacent to the Mall of Georgia. The largest tenant at the property, Burlington Coat Factory (50,000 SF, 12.4% of NRA) took over the previous Toys R Us space in 2018 with a lease expiration in May 2022. Additional tenants at the property include Bed Bath & Beyond (33,889 SF, 8.4% of NRA), Ross (30,093 SF, 7.5% of NRA), Marshall's (30,000 SF, 7.5% of NRA). In April 2020, Painted Tree Marketplace (30,000 SF, 7.5% of NRA) backfilled the former Stein Mart space. As of September 2020, the property occupancy and DSCR NOI were 99% and 3.58x. The loan is interest-only through its entire term. Moody's LTV and stressed DSCR are 89% and 1.10X, respectively, the same as at the last review.REGULATORY DISCLOSURESFor further specification of Moody's key rating assumptions and sensitivity analysis, see the sections Methodology Assumptions and Sensitivity to Assumptions in the disclosure form. Moody's Rating Symbols and Definitions can be found at: https://www.moodys.com/researchdocumentcontentpage.aspx?docid=PBC_79004.The analysis includes an assessment of collateral characteristics and performance to determine the expected collateral loss or a range of expected collateral losses or cash flows to the rated instruments.

2021-03-23T12:28:12.000Z,Bed Bath & Beyond's (BBBY) Nestwell Launch to Aid Transformation,"The pandemic has introduced several changes in our daily lives, including stay-at-home practices. In doing so, people are ending up lounging on the bed for most part of the day. Also, the stay-at-home trend has aroused interest among people for enhancing or renovating their home space and spending more on home items. Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. BBBY is cashing-in on this new-found appreciation for the home space with the launch of its latest private label brand — Nestwell.

The new product line offers a wide range of affordable and comfortable bedding and bath products, including sheets, pillows, blankets, duvets, mattress toppers, bath towels and bath accessories, which will be available only at Bed Bath & Beyond stores and Bedbathandbeyond.com from Mar 22. Customers can avail delivery options such as Buy-Online-Pickup-In-Store (BOPIS), contactless curbside pickup and same-day delivery at the time of purchase.

Further, it comes with an online quiz, namely Nestwell to Rest Well, which helps identify customers’ nesting archetypes, curate designing beds by interior designers at Decorist and products that suit their individual sleeping pattern.

This move comes after significant growth across store-owned or private-label brands compared with the national brands. Also, industry experts believe that Bed Bath & Beyond’s latest development is one of the first blows to shatter Target’s TGT dominance in the home business. Going ahead, the company remains focused on meeting consumers’ growing demand across segments, such as bed, bath, kitchen and dining, storage and organization as well as home decor. Apart from these, its comprehensive growth strategy includes plans to launch thousands of new products, exclusively available only at Bed Bath & Beyond.

Keeping in these lines, the company plans to launch seven more store-owned or private-label brands in fiscal 2021. Moreover, the company is likely to introduce at least 10 Owned Brands in the next two years. The sales penetration of Owned Brands is expected to grow from 10% to nearly 30% within the first three years. These actions are expected to boost the company’s footing in the $180-billion Home market.

These endeavors are part of its transformation plans in a bid to achieve improved profits over the next two-three years. Notably, management is on track to invest $1-$1.5 billion over the next three years, out of which $250 million will be utilized to remodel roughly 60% of stores and the remaining will likely be spent on improving the supply chain and digital capabilities. Driven by such upsides, the company envisions low- to mid-single-digit same-store sales growth and an operating profit of $1 billion by 2023, according to sources.

All said, we hope that such well-chalked plans are likely to boost top-line growth in the near term. In the past three months, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock surged 70.7%, outperforming the industry’s growth of 13.6%.   ",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bed-bath-beyonds-bbby-nestwell-122812917.html

2021-03-22T17:36:12.000Z,Bed Bath & Beyond just launched its first of several attacks on Target's home dominance,"Target (TGT) has had it pretty easy in the home goods space this past year as its cheap chic assortment of pillows, bedding, bath products and other home merchandise has easily lured in quarantined consumers and racked up big sales. Helping matters for Target during the pandemic has been the exit of Pier 1 from the marketplace (it liquidated in 2020), legacy challenges at Bed Bath & Beyond (BBBY) and the fact it sells food. But Target's next 12 months in the home business could be a bit more challenging as Bed Bath & Beyond's CEO Mark Tritton — a former Target executive credited for numerous successful private label goods launches — gears up for his first offensive at the home goods retailer he has started to turn around after joining in November 2019. That offensive by Tritton and his new executive team kicked off on Monday. The company launched its Nestwell bedding and bath private label line Monday. Prices for Nestwell products range from $6.00 for washcloths, $10 to $20 for towels, and $30 to $120 for sheets — all relatively in the ballpark with Target's prices. ""Nestwell is a solutions-oriented brand that takes the guesswork out of everyday bedding and bath products,"" said Bed Bath & Beyond chief merchandising officer Joe Hartsig. Nestwell marks the first of 10 private label lines expected from Tritton. April will bring the debut of Haven, a ""spa-inpired assortment"" of organic cotton products for bath use. This month will also bring the debut of Simply Essential, which will encompass 1,000 household essentials. After a little more than a year spent cleaning up the major failings of prior management, Tritton recently unveiled his playbook on how he will reinvent the home furnishings retailer. The company plans to invest $1 billion to $1.5 billion in the business over the next three years. During that stretch, Tritton will earmark $250 million to remodel some 60% of Bed Bath & Beyond stores. The rest of the funds will be split between improvements to e-commerce technology and the supply chain. Money will be spent on launching its 10 new private label brands, too.

ALEXIS CHRISTOFOROUS: Let's talk about more of the markets now with Christopher Uhl. He is founder and head trader at 10-MinuteStockTrader. Chris, good to see you again. I'm just curious if you own any of these meme stocks that Jared was just talking about. And what might you tell investors who are either playing with these stocks right now or enticed to? CHRISTOPHER UHL: Well, Alexis, thanks for having me back on. Actually, the last time we spoke, I was in AMC and had gotten out of it and doubled my money in the meantime. But right now, no, I don't have anything on. I'm actually looking at the energy sector and the financial sector. Those two have been on a very hot streak lately. But I will say, I had a couple of people texting me this morning with their GameStop shares that they accidentally have had for a decade and wound up in this fortunate position. I said, you know what? Hang on for the ride. Nobody knows how high this is going to go. We saw a couple months ago the volatility that can be in there. But you know what? Hang on for the ride. At some point, it'll come back down, and maybe then will be the time to take profits. But in the meantime, who knows how high this could go? ALEXIS CHRISTOFOROUS: Wait, why would you want to take profits when it comes back down, Christopher? I mean, I would think if you got this stock as, like, a gift a decade ago or something because you were into video games and GameStop, you see the tremendous ride it's been on, maybe it does make sense. I mean, these people certainly aren't day trading. Maybe it does make sense for them to take those profits now. CHRISTOPHER UHL: You've got an excellent point. But we never know how high this is going to go. Especially with the momentum and the fuel behind this, I mean, this could hit $1,000. And maybe when it comes back down, I'm not talking about it comes back down to five or 10. I'm talking about when it retraces maybe 5% or 10% from its high. I certainly wouldn't want someone to watch this go up to 350 and then back down to 5 and have really nothing to show for it. That's what I mean. We're going to trend trade this as high and as far as we can.         ",https://finance.yahoo.com/video/investors-dip-two-sectors-amid-192813255.html

2021-03-09T21:52:10.000Z,Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. -- Moody's announces completion of a periodic review of ratings of Bed Bath & Beyond Inc.,"Announcement of Periodic Review: Moody's announces completion of a periodic review of ratings of Bed Bath & Beyond Inc.Global Credit Research - 09 Mar 2021New York, March 09, 2021 -- Moody's Investors Service (""Moody's"") has completed a periodic review of the ratings of Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. and other ratings that are associated with the same analytical unit. The review was conducted through a portfolio review discussion held on 4 March 2021 in which Moody's reassessed the appropriateness of the ratings in the context of the relevant principal methodology(ies), recent developments, and a comparison of the financial and operating profile to similarly rated peers. The review did not involve a rating committee. Since 1 January 2019, Moody's practice has been to issue a press release following each periodic review to announce its completion.This publication does not announce a credit rating action and is not an indication of whether or not a credit rating action is likely in the near future. Credit ratings and outlook/review status cannot be changed in a portfolio review and hence are not impacted by this announcement. For any credit ratings referenced in this publication, please see the ratings tab on the issuer/entity page on www.moodys.com for the most updated credit rating action information and rating history.Key rating considerations are summarized below.Bed Bath & Beyond Inc.'s Ba3 corporate family rating reflects the increased demand for its major home categories during the pandemic offset by the intense competition from e-commerce and other value players including the discounters. Bed Bath continues to make progress on improving product assortment, marketing, inventory, supply chain optimization and omni-channel capabilities; nonetheless, these actions must continue at a rapid pace for Bed Bath to return to former levels of profitability. The company benefits from scale as the largest dedicated retailer of domestic merchandise and home furnishings, its national footprint is supported by a good distribution network, and financial flexibility to support its transformation effort. Additionally, Bed Bath's recent divestitures will streamline its business focus and the closure of 200 lower performing stores will allow the of recapture sales at nearby stores or online and lower occupancy costs.This document summarizes Moody's view as of the publication date and will not be updated until the next periodic review announcement, which will incorporate material changes in credit circumstances (if any) during the intervening period.The principal methodology used for this review was Retail Industry published in May 2018. Please see the Rating Methodologies page on www.moodys.com for a copy of this methodology.This announcement applies only to EU rated, UK rated, EU endorsed and UK endorsed ratings.

It’s getting a third boost from the waning of the pandemic. Source: Sundry Photography/Shutterstock.com But KSS stock isn’t yet priced like Five Below (NASDAQ:FIVE) or even Walmart (NYSE:WMT). Now at $55, Kohl’s has a market cap of $8.7 billion, still just a little over half fiscal 2021’s sales of $16 billion. If it can get sales back even to 2019’s $20 billion in sales and come close to the pace of $2.20 per share in earnings from last quarter, it’s a bargain. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Whether it will accomplish that, of course, is speculative, which is why I recently took profits of 34% on a small Kohl’s position. I bought Kohl’s late last year, based on CEO Michelle Gass and hopes for a retail rebound. 9 Cheap Stocks That Look Like a Bargain I got out because I think Jonathan Duskin of Macellum Capital, whose allies now hold 9.5% of the stock, are making a mistake. Their letter blames Gass, who joined the company from Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) in 2014 and became CEO in 2018, for things she’s in the process of fixing. It also attacks her salary and the corporate jet, which is rich coming from a bunch of hedge fund guys. Media reports on the group quote its brag on being right about Bed, Bath & Beyond (NASDAQ:BBBY). They were. After they moved in the home goods chain replaced his CEO and set a new strategy. I’ve made money on that stock, too. But strategy is what Kohl’s got in hiring Gass. It’s also clear that the turnaround has begun. Kohl’s beat earnings estimates over Christmas, with online representing 42% of the take. The company’s alliance with Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), which now has return desks in its stores, have brought 2 million new customers into Kohl’s. Kohl’s had been a low-price department store before Gass, a cross between Target (NYSE:TGT) and TJX Companies’ (NYSE:TJX) TJ Maxx. The stores were just too big for the online world.

""We believe Kohl’s fourth quarter earnings report and full year 2021 guidance substantiate the immediate need for change on the Board. The Board seems to be content performing just slightly better than the worst companies in retail. 'Best of the worst' is not a viable strategy, nor does it satisfy shareholders like us seeking long-term superior performance,"" said the activist group of Macellum Advisors, Ancora Holdings, Legion Partners Asset Management and 4010 Capital in a new letter Friday. Together, the group owns about 9.5% of the outstanding shares of Kohl's. The letter continued, ""Further, we do not believe the company’s recent results are indicative of a strategy that is succeeding. The Investor Group believes that the company’s weak earnings and guidance are demonstrative of a Board comprised of directors lacking relevant retail expertise who are not in a position to provide the necessary oversight to help Kohl’s get back on track. In our view, a substantially refreshed Board with relevant retail expertise can help devise a strategy to take market share back from competitors and not just settle for being better than troubled mall-based department stores."" Shares of Kohl's (KSS) fell 2% Friday on the news. Kohl's wasted no time firing back. ""As we recently disclosed, our business is building momentum and we have a clear strategy to accelerate revenues and profitability. Our recent operating results outperform across key metrics and demonstrate that we are on the right path. The activist investor group’s comparisons of 2019 results to expectations for 2021 are nonsensical given a continuing global pandemic,"" Kohl's spokeswoman Julia Fennelly said in an emailed statement to Yahoo Finance. ""The activist’s comments and track record reveal that they are focused on short-term payout at the expense of sustainable success. The Kohl’s board of directors and management have successfully positioned our company for a multi-year improvement at the top and bottom line. We reject the activists’ short-termism and their attempt to disrupt our momentum at this critical time. We remain open and interested in new ideas that can help us increase value for our company and our shareholders.""

2021-03-05T15:40:28.000Z,Return On Capital Employed Overview: Bed Bath & Beyond,"During Q3, Bed Bath & Beyond (NASDAQ:BBBY) brought in sales totaling $2.62 billion. However, earnings decreased 111.03%, resulting in a loss of $8.94 million. In Q2, Bed Bath & Beyond earned $81.02 million, and total sales reached $2.69 billion. What Is ROCE? Changes in earnings and sales indicate shifts in Bed Bath & Beyond's Return on Capital Employed, a measure of yearly pre-tax profit relative to capital employed by a business. Generally, a higher ROCE suggests successful growth of a company and is a sign of higher earnings per share in the future. In Q3, Bed Bath & Beyond posted an ROCE of -0.01%. It is important to keep in mind ROCE evaluates past performance and is not used as a predictive tool. It is a good measure of a company's recent performance, but several factors could affect earnings and sales in the near future. View more earnings on BBBY Return on Capital Employed is an important measurement of efficiency and a useful tool when comparing companies that operate in the same industry. A relatively high ROCE indicates a company may be generating profits that can be reinvested into more capital, leading to higher returns and growing EPS for shareholders. In Bed Bath & Beyond's case, the ROCE ratio shows the amount of assets may not be helping the company achieve higher returns. Investors may take this into account before making any long-term financial decisions. Q3 Earnings Insight Bed Bath & Beyond reported Q3 earnings per share at $0.08/share, which did not meet analyst predictions of $0.19/share.

2021-03-04T20:48:34.000Z,What's Behind Bed Bath & Beyond CEO's Private Label Strategy?,"Home goods retailer Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. (NASDAQ: BBBY) announced Wednesday the launch of at least eight company-owned brands in reaction to a major ""migration"" among consumers towards private labels across the entire retail industry, Bed Bath & Beyond CEO Mark Tritton said on CNBC's ""Squawk on the Street."" What Happened: Bed Bath & Beyond's private label announcement is part of the company's three-year transformation plan. The decision to invest in its own brands is based on growing demand among consumers to try new brands from stores they trust. Management is guided for the sales penetration of its brands to grow from around 10% to around 30% within three years. ""The opportunity to create custom products for customers' homes at really affordable price points — good, better, best in every one of our rooms and categories,"" the CEO said. Related Link: This Analyst Says Bed Bath & Beyond Has 'Many New Tools In The Basket' Why It's Important: Private labels also offer Bed Bath & Beyond higher margins compared to national brands. While margin upside is a ""fantastic"" outcome, it is not the main motivation. Bed Bath & Beyond plans on eliminating existing brands and replacing them with its own brands. This could cause confusion among customers and even store associates, especially as it comes at the same time as store remodels. What's Next: The company's initiatives and multi-year timeline towards growth have in part attracted Wall Street analysts to take another look at the stock, the CEO said. Many analysts are attracted to the ongoing ""agile transformation"" that is ""very credible"" that could translate to strong EBITDA performance.

2021-03-04T14:48:02.000Z,Bed Bath & Beyond (BBBY) Plans to Roll Out Owned Brands,"Leading retailer of home furnishing products and other domestic merchandise — Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. BBBY — is in an assortment expansion spree. As part of its three-year transformation plan, the company will launch at least eight new Owned Brands in fiscal 2021. Another major step in its comprehensive growth strategy includes plans to launch thousand of new products, exclusively available only at Bed Bath & Beyond. These actions are expected to boost the company’s footing in the $180 billion Home market. Let’s dive deeper. Management highlighted that its latest move to expand Owned Brands assortment is one of its major product-based initiative undertaken in a generation. Out of the eight new Owned Brands planned to be launched in fiscal 2021, six brands will be launched in each of the first six months of the fiscal year. Moreover, the company plans to introduce at least 10 Owned Brands in the next two years.

Management expects its transformational Owned Brands program to begin later this month, with the launch of Nestwell — an assortment of quality bed and bath goods. The Nestwell brand is likely to boost the company’s presence in the sleep category. The company also plans to relaunch the Haven bath brand in April, which will offer a spa-inspired assortment of organic cotton products and more. Further, the company plans to introduce Simply Essential — an Owned Brand assortment that will include more than 1,000 household essentials. These highly functional, well-designed products will be offered at a great value across multiple categories. The company highlighted that the new Owned Brands will cater to consumer needs across segments such as bed, bath, kitchen and dining, storage and organization as well as home decor. In fact, these products will form part of the company’s key category that contribute more than 60% to its revenues. Moreover, management expects the sales penetration of Owned Brands to grow from 10% to nearly 30% within the first three years. Further, the company expects to boost gross margin by strategically managing costs and sourcing.

Clearly, Bed Bath & Beyond is focused on boosting consumers’ shopping experience by offering a wide range of home related merchandise needed for comfortable and enjoyable living. Its latest initiative to offer a range of Owned Brands is likely to transform its assortment and also create substantial opportunities for long-term growth. Moreover, as the company enters its 50th year, management looks forward to welcoming customers with new collections in reimagined stores. Such upsides along with the company’s focus on expanding digital capacity, omni-channel offerings and well-chalked marketing strategies are likely to keep the company in good shape in the forthcoming periods.

2021-03-02T19:22:35.000Z,Kohl's better than expected quarter probably does nothing to quiet activist concerns,"Kohl's (KSS) looks to be staying in its own world despite the arrival of new activist investors seeking to shake up the struggling off-mall department store. Hence, Kohl's investors should expect this brewing saga to play out for a good bit with an outcome that is far from certain. Kohl's said on Tuesday it's fourth quarter sales plunged 10.1% year-over-year to $6.1 billion as the retailer continued to reel from the COVID-19 pandemic. Operating profits came in at $316 million, down 21% from a year ago. For the full year, Kohl's saw sales drop 20% to $15.9 billion. The company posted an operating loss of $262 million. Helped by a $1.15 a share tax benefit, Kohl's managed to beat Wall Street profit estimates for the quarter. Total Sales: $6.1 billion vs. $5.9 billion Adjusted Diluted EPS: $2.22 vs. $0.98 Full Year 2021 Guidance: mid-teens percentage sales increase and $2.45 to $2.95 in earnings per share Shares rose 1% in Tuesday trading as Kohl's said it would reinstate its dividend (to 25 cents a share) and repurchase $200 million to $300 million in stock this year. A Kohl's spokesperson struck a very upbeat note after what was a challenging quarter and year. ""Kohl’s is extremely confident in the company’s outlook,"" Kohl's spokeswoman Julia Fennelly said via an email blast Tuesday morning. ""Kohl’s delivered strong initial progress against its strategy in the past two quarters, and is positioned to deliver a multi-year improvement in sales and operating margin. Kohl’s will also be resuming its capital allocation strategy in 2021."" The rosy commentary unlikely sits well with Kohl's new activist investors. In fact, they may be emboldened to push harder for change at a retailer so resistant to change and lacking in financial execution.

The activist group includes Macellum Advisors, Ancora Holdings, Legion Partners Asset Management and 4010 Capital. They now control a combined 9.5% stake in Kohl’s, according to a new letter published Monday. The news was first reported by The Wall Street Journal. Kohl's shares rose 8% in afternoon trading. The group nominated nine people to Kohl's already enormous 12-person board, the letter says. The activists are pushing for Kohl's to slash inventory levels to cut costs, do a sale-leaseback transaction for some stores to boost cash and lower costs and make promotions easier for customers to understand. ""The Board has overseen a long list of sales and margin driving initiatives which have created no meaningful value for shareholders,"" the activists wrote in a scathing new letter to management.

SEANA SMITH: One of the losers in today's market that we mentioned earlier, GameStop. That stock under pressure, but really more broadly speaking, short-selling is in focus after lawmakers pressed the CEOs of Robinhood, of Citadel, of Melvin Capital, just to name a few, yesterday. For more on this, we want to bring in Joe Saluzzi. He's of Themis Trading. He's the co-founder there and co-head of equity trading. He joins us now on the phone. And Joe, there's a lot to get into yesterday's hearing. I think the big takeaways, at least for us-- we were talking before the show-- was short-selling and then payment for order flow. So let's start on the short-selling real quick. I guess, the big debate is whether or not there needs to be more transparency around it right now. What do you think? JOE SALUZZI: Well, thanks, Seana, for having me. I think, you know, short-selling is-- it's not-- you know, it's not an evil thing. It's actually a healthy thing for the market when you think about it. You know, some short-sellers will expose poorly managed companies. They will be an activist style investment, where, you know, they're coming in at a different angle. And it's extremely risky to be a short-seller because your losses are infinite when you think about it, right? Because as the stock goes up, you're losing money. But transparency, it's a difficult thing because, you know, as Melvin Capital realized, once people realize that you're short, once they see you're short, they could put a run on it. And then that's where you will get squeezed out. So I think it's difficult. You know, if you had a 5%, 10% hold, like you do on the long side, on the short side, maybe there is some valid reasons to identify that as a long-term short holder. But shorts tend to come and go pretty quickly. So I don't know, to be honest with you, whether-- what's the right answer on transparency. All I can tell you is that, you know, it's not a bad thing short-selling. What's bad is when you don't have a borrow and it's what they call naked short-selling. That's illegal, first of all.

In the third quarter, revenues came to $119.5 million, down from $1.3 billion on a year-over-year basis. Furthermore, the net loss was $905.8 million. But AMC has taken swift actions to cut back on costs. Part of this has been to take capital expenditures to minimum maintenance levels. Then there has been the cutting back on non-essential expenses as well as the renegotiation of leases.

There has been a lot of confusion, conspiracy theories, complex market dynamics, loss, gain, and drama, and Congress hopes to clear up some of these things. Expect questions about conflicts of interest, market manipulation, the internal workings of how stock trades happen, how trading data is shared, and more. Still, don’t expect everything to be cleared up and tied with a pretty bow, even if the five witnesses will be answering questions under oath. “My experience is that these hearings are tough on both [Congress]members and witnesses as the witnesses know much more about the subject matter than the members of the Committee,” Tom Block, Fundstrat’s expert in Washington’s inner workings, wrote in a recent note. “Members can get lost in questioning that a staff member may have written but is not fully understood by the member; and the witnesses need to be careful not to appear to be talking down to the Committee members.” Because of this, Block and others see the SEC as the body that will clear up any issues. 12 p.m. ET.

Ahead of that, though, we're getting some reports here that one of the more influential voices on that Wall Street Bets forum on Reddit has been hit with a class action lawsuit. Let's bring in Jared Blikre, who is following that story for us. Jared. JARED BLIKRE: Right, so this would be Keith Gill, also known as Roaring Kitty. And this is a lawsuit that was just filed in Massachusetts federal court by Christian Iovin, individually and on behalf of all other similar-- similarly situated. Just reading through the filing right now, but I'll give you a couple of excerpts here. There's a quote. ""Gill's deceitful and manipulative conduct not only violates numerous industry regulations and rules, but also various securities laws by undermining the integrity of the market for GameStop shares."" And it looks like they're alleging that he is-- because he's a licensed security professional, he shouldn't have been saying what he said. Now, I mean, you look at what's Game-- GameStop is definitely not under the same pressure it was a few weeks ago. But it is interesting, the timing of this class action lawsuit, just ahead of these hearings. You've got to imagine there's going to be a lot of lawsuits against a lot of parties here. But I want to focus now in a couple of markets a couple of stocks that are kind of breaking down today. Now here is Apple. Despite the attention on GameStop, this is still the biggest stock in the universe. And you can see it's dipping below-- it's dipping below its 50-day moving average. In theory, we could have a head and shoulders top that's been broken, this neckline right here. So we're going to want to keep an eye on that. Also, of Tesla. Tesla touching its 50-day moving average, but now below 800. So I think it could possibly rebound from here. It would be a false breakdown. But it could also go lower. And then finally, Peloton. Not the biggest market leader, but emblematic of the work from home trade. That is trading below its 50-day as well. Guys.",https://finance.yahoo.com/video/roaring-kitty-sued-securities-fraud-181512853.html
2021-02-12T18:23:32.000Z,"What to do if you lost money on GameStop, AMC, or other ‘meme stocks’","GameStop (GME) is nowhere near the price level it was at the end of January as the stock’s meteoric rise captivated the country in a groundbreaking, Reddit-powered short squeeze. The shape of the stock chart — a giant M — and volume mean that a lot of people bought GameStop at far more than the current market price of around $50 as of Friday. In the current casino-like dynamics of the stock market, many investors might decide to ride the table and win their money back, hoping for a turnaround in the stock price. But there’s another strategy frequently used to make lemonade from the market’s lemons: tax-loss harvesting. Though it’s too late to use a “meme stock” trade for the return you have to file this spring, it’s a strategy you can use for 2021 on your 2020 year return. “For every investor who made a profit on meme stocks like GME and AMC, there are many others who are now in the red,” Wealthfront CPA Tony Molina wrote in a note. “I know from experience that it doesn’t feel good being on that side of the volatile market, but there are a few things you can do if you recently lost money while day trading.” Here’s what it is and how it works. Realizing a loss to offset your income An investor doing their taxes either takes a standard deduction or itemized deductions. Often, tax preparers — or tax software — will do both and see which is most advantageous. Investors can use losses to offset gains in the market, which reduces taxes owed. If they don’t have any gains to offset, they can use that money to offset taxes on ordinary income like wages, up to $3,000. Imagine you bought $5,000 worth of stock and sold it two weeks later for $4,000 because you decided you didn’t like it anymore and wanted to cut your losses. You’ve realized a $1,000 loss by selling, and you can subtract $1,000 from your taxable income. Which part of the taxable income depends. If you have any short-term capital gains — gains from stocks that you’ve held for less than a year — having losses can be useful.

2021-02-11T19:20:59.000Z,This Analyst Says Bed Bath & Beyond Has 'Many New Tools In The Basket',"Home goods retailer Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. (NASDAQ: BBBY) has ""many new tools in the basket"" that position the home goods retailer to achieve its 2023 profit objectives, according to BofA Securities. The Bed Bath & Beyond Analyst: Curtis Nagle upgraded Bed Bath & Beyond from Neutral to Buy with a price target lowered from $55 to $38. The Bed Bath & Beyond Thesis: Bed Bath & Beyond's stock has fallen sharply from its 52-week high of $53.90 and investors should take advantage of the dip, Nagle wrote in the note. Led by a new management team, the company should show growth in 2021 and hits its 2023 target of $850 million to $1 billion. Management also deserves credit for divesting its non-core assets that generated more than $600 million in cash and a commitment to continue closing underperforming stores. This puts the company in a strong enough position to both invest in growth initiatives and return capital to investors. Related Link: 2 Analysts Downgrade Bed Bath & Beyond, Stock Still Pops 30% The future of Bed Bath & Beyond stores will look different through remodels and a merchandising overhaul with a focus on higher-margin owned brands. The company expects this will translate to topline, earnings and new customer growth. ""The most consistent pushback from clients is BBBY's underperformance to peers and tough industry 2H21 compares, but BBBY has a slew of growth initiatives and margin boosters in the works that we do not believe are fully appreciated or believed yet,"" the analyst wrote.

[MUSIC PLAYING] MYLES UDLAND: All right, just after 10:00 here in New York City on this Thursday morning. Welcome to ""Yahoo Finance Live."" Myles Udland here, joined as always by Brian Sozzi and Julie Hyman on this very special edition of our two-hour program, ""Inside the C-suite."" What's the count? Seven, eight guests, C-suite guests coming up over the next or more coming up in our next hour a couple of hours? Already talked to four so far. Do more coming up later on in this hour. Let's take a look first at what's happening in the markets today. We can see all three majors are higher, but off session highs. Not doing a whole lot. NASDAQ continues to be the relative leader. Jared Blikre talking earlier about we've seen in both the NASDAQ and the Russell doing a lot of the leading as of late within the market. But things do seem to be calming down just a little bit after all the craziness we saw with GameStop. But that doesn't really mean there are no mean trades out there. We'll get into that in just a minute. Do want to talk a bit about what's happening in Bitcoin. But a very exciting week, as it always is for the cryptocurrency. News out earlier today that BNY Mellon would begin basically holding Bitcoin. And the quote that they gave to ""The Wall Street Journal"" was that they would treat it like any other asset. So I think a couple of different ways to maybe read that one. But my read on the story was certainly that they're getting questions from their high net worth individual clients about how they can buy Bitcoin. And this move seems prompted by that dynamic. Again, at least as far as I'm interpreting that story. And I think that's really going to be a big part of how Bitcoin becomes a more mainstream Wall Street story, is individuals saying, I would like to own this. Please help me do that. And we start to see some of the outlines there. Fidelity is in the space a little bit already. And now we see Mellon getting in the mix there. $47,900 on Bitcoin, and of course, who could forget Elon Musk earlier this week putting a billion and a half on Tesla's balance sheet. Uber CEO, Dara Khosrowshahi asked about buying Bitcoin on the call last night. And I guess that's now a question if you're the CEO of a tech or tech adjacent business, you will be asked when are you also going to buy Bitcoin. So certainly exciting times for all of those folks.",https://finance.yahoo.com/video/worst-stocks-doing-best-morning-152722056.html

2021-02-06T16:30:04.000Z,Why Is Bed Bath & Beyond (BBBY) Up 41.7% Since Last Earnings Report?,"A month has gone by since the last earnings report for Bed Bath & Beyond (BBBY). Shares have added about 41.7% in that time frame, outperforming the S&P 500. Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Bed Bath & Beyond due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts. Bed Bath & Beyond posted its third-quarter fiscal 2020 results, wherein both top and bottom lines lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Results were hurt by COVID-related headwinds, including dismal store traffic, significant shipping constraints and increased freight expenses. Although adverse impacts of COVID-19 weighed on third-quarter store sales in its BABY business, it returned to growth in December.

Moreover, the company reported second successive quarter of comparable sales and profit growth. Solid cash flow and a strong balance sheet remained key upsides. Encouragingly, management announced to reinitiate shareholder returns.

Apart from these, it undertook several measures for the recent holiday season, including enhanced omni-channel facilities — contactless new store and curbside pickup, and same-day delivery services — for which it received positive customer feedback. Also, demand remained strong during the holiday season. Keeping in these lines, the company noted that total enterprise comparable sales were sturdy in the first month of the fiscal fourth quarter. Bed Bath & Beyond reported adjusted earnings of 8 cents per share for the fiscal third quarter, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 20 cents. However, the figure reflects a sharp improvement from a loss of 38 cents reported in the year-ago quarter. This uptick was mainly attributed to improved margins and lower expenses.

Net sales came in at $2,618 million, down 5% year over year due to the sale of non-core businesses and store closures. Moreover, it lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2,756 million. Also, digital sales rose roughly 75% in the reported quarter. Several omni-channel services, such as Buy-Online-Pick-Up-In-Store and Curbside Pickup, contributed to digital sales growth.

Evidently, BOPIS now accounts for more than 16% of total digital sales. Driven by its strong omni-channel capabilities, Bed Bath & Beyond witnessed new customer acquisition to the tune of more than 2 million in the reported quarter. On the flip side, in-store sales fell 17% in the reported quarter.

During the quarter, comparable sales (comps) grew 2% year over year driven by growth in the Bed Bath & Beyond banner and strong digital comps. Home Organization, Kitchen Food Prep, Bedding, Bath and Indoor Décor acted as key growth categories, with combined comp sales growth of 11%.

Also, these categories collectively accounted for two-thirds of total Bed Bath & Beyond unit sales in the quarter under review. Moving on, the company has increased investments in these key categories to strengthen its position in the home space.

During the five-day holiday sales period from Thanksgiving to Cyber Monday, the company witnessed double-digit growth year over year in overall comps for the core U.S. Bed Bath & Beyond banner, with digital comps up roughly 69%, which more than offset the in-store comps decline of 24%.

Adjusted gross profit advanced 4.1% to $926.2 million in the fiscal third quarter. Moreover, adjusted gross margin expanded 310 basis points (bps) to 35.4% on positive product mix, higher markdowns, better promotions, as well as lower distribution and fulfillment costs. On the flip side, adverse digital channel mix and elevated shipping costs acted as deterrents.

Meanwhile, SG&A expenses fell 4.5% to $890.7 million, driven by reduced advertising expenses and lower payroll.

Further, the company incurred an operating loss of $122.8 million, wider than a loss of $29.8 million in the year-ago quarter.            ",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-bed-bath-beyond-bbby-163004780.html
2021-02-04T19:42:07.000Z,Is It Time For The Equity Market To Sober Up?,"The market isn’t as efficient as many would allude that algos and HFTs have made it. The democratization of the financial markets, ultra-low interest rate, and high future growth environment have created a new market that freshman and senior traders are both learning. Retail investors have caught Wall Street off guard with the Big Short-Squeeze on some of the most shorted names in the market, like GameStop GME, AMC AMC, and Bed Bath & Beyond BBBY. The new cohort of r/wallstreetbets traders are proving to the world of high finance that retail investors/traders are a force to be reckoned with. Market fundamentals and valuations have seemingly been thrown out the window (at least in the short-term). I don’t think this market euphoria can last much longer. Many retail investors have been temporarily scared out of stocks by the much-expected capitulation of GME, AMC, and BBBY, with many of these new high-risk traders not having the word sell in their lexicon. We have traded effectively sideways since big tech earnings kicked off two weeks ago. We had tremendous results from the biggest and baddest tech giants, but the markets seemed to have more than priced in earnings beats from market-moving innovative giants like Apple AAPL, Microsoft MSFT, and Amazon AMZN. Traders were buying the rumors of good earnings expectations, and when these great earnings came to fruition, they sold the news. The markets are looking toppy from every angle. It appears that all of the optimism is already baked in. I expect to see a 10-15% pullback in the coming weeks/months. Like the famous John Maynard Keynes said, “the markets can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent.” Don’t try to time the correction, but be cautious with your market purchases. 5 Stocks Set to Double

2021-02-02T23:15:28.000Z,Before WallStreetBets: A history of online message boards and 'stonks',"The r/WallStreetBets community on Reddit appears to be the modern reincarnation of online message boards of years’ past. Sites like Silicon Investing, Raging Bull, and this one — Yahoo Finance — served as open forums for investors to anonymously float ideas during the dot-com bubble that popped in 2000. ADAM SHAPIRO: So instead of riding the GameStop roller coaster, perhaps you want to learn more about the history of WallStreetBets and other online messaging boards. Brian Cheung is going to school us on that, Brian. BRIAN CHEUNG: Well, Adam, it seems like everyone's interested in this new phenomenon of WallStreetBets and Reddit. But we have to remember that it wasn't much long ago that we saw something very similar with the advent of the internet around the dot-com bubble. There were many types of message boards. I'm going to take you down memory lane, things like ragingbull.com, siliconinvestor.com, this website, yahoofinance.com. These are all message boards where people floated investment ideas at the time. Now, consider an example of a company called Zitel. This was a company that a lot of people on siliconinvestor.com and the Motley Fool had tried to pump on the promise that this was a tech company that was going to deliver a cure to the Y2K bug, you remember, whether or not computers were going to explode when the calendar turned from 1999 to 2000. Here's an example of one post that was on siliconinvestor.com in 1996. It read, ""at the end, the people who don't like that--"" which refers to the people that were trying to pump the stock of Zitel-- ""are, A, the shorts and, two, those who are not long. For those of us who are long-- I have a few shares 19-- let the good times roll."" Again, this is coming from 1996. But you can see how the views of this are very similar to what we're seeing in the WallStreetBets sub Reddit. Very interesting to see how this is all kind of coming back into vogue almost 20 years later. When you look back at Yahoo Finance message boards, though, we see cautionary tales of the types of misinformation, though, that can come from this, one example being the Whole Foods CEO John Mackey. He was using a pseudonym at the time on Yahoo Finance message boards, complimenting not only how he personally looked, but also trying to talk down his rival, which was Wild Oats. The FTC and the SEC ended up investigating that, but a very cautionary tale that shows just how interestingly history tends to repeat itself, Seana, Adam.

2021-02-02T16:55:23.000Z,Reddit traders are helping to inflate a bond bubble: Ark's Cathie Wood,"The massive short squeeze that sent GameStop (GME) shares soaring 1600% last month was the final shred of evidence needed for some investors to declare the stock market bubble officially here. Not so fast, says Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood. “I will not believe we are in a bubble in equities,” Wood told Yahoo Finance Presents. In fact, Wood says Reddit traders are “aiding and abetting the bond bubble.” She noted that many of the companies getting the attention of these traders had been “left for dead by innovation,” and so the value of their bonds had been depressed. Because of the high risk of bankruptcy, refinancing costs for these companies have been extremely high. But the surging stock prices fueled by these retail traders have given these companies an attractive source of capital. “They're actually accessing the equity markets. They're not refinancing the debt,” Wood said. “They're accessing the equity markets and their bond prices are skyrocketing.“ She also went back a bit further, noting funds have been flowing out of equities and into bonds since 2017. For Wood, this is further evidence that if there is a bubble in the markets, it’s in the bond market. “I believe bonds are in a bubble,” she said. “I believe what just happened with GameStop and AMC (AMC) and American Airlines (AAL) and Bed Bath & Beyond (BBBY) — all of those — is exacerbating the bond bubble. Because you're bailing those bondholders out, so they can put money elsewhere.” The action fueled by retail investors on Reddit’s WallStreetBets has garnered attention for its impact on hedge funds that have been short stocks. But Wood says it’s the action in the bonds for the so-called meme stocks that has caught her attention and she’s not buying. See Also: Why Ark's Cathie Wood remains bullish on Bitcoin, Tesla “If you ask me, a student of innovation, maybe there's a shot of survival here and maybe more so now that they've been able to do an equity offering, which they could not have done two weeks ago, maybe,” Wood said. “But I would not be putting my money there. I want to be on the right side of change.”          ",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/reddit-traders-inflate-bond-bubble-ark-cathie-wood-165523187.html
2021-02-02T16:27:04.000Z,Bed Bath & Beyond (BBBY) Concludes $225M Share Repurchase Plan,"In sync with its strong shareholder values, Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. BBBY has completed its $225 million worth of accelerated share-repurchase program, which was announced on Oct 29, 2020.

Per the plan, the company bought back roughly 11 million shares of its common stock at an average price of $20.77. Moreover, it extended the end date of its second accelerated share-repurchase plan worth $150 million until April 2021 instead of February. Notably, the second buyback plan was initially announced on Jan 11.

Moreover, the $225-million accelerated share repurchase plan is part of the company’s up to $825-million accelerated share-repurchase authorization, which is valid for the next three years. This reflects an increase from $675 million stated earlier. Also, the move comes after management revealed plans to restart shareholder returns on its third-quarter fiscal 2020 earnings call. That said, Bed Bath & Beyond boasts liquidity of $2.2 billion, driven by a solid cash flow of $244 million as of Nov 28, 2020, which is likely to help it stay afloat amid the crisis.

Markedly, shares of this company have rallied 46.4% in the past three months compared with the industry’s growth of 13.9%. Given the ongoing pandemic, Bed Bath & Beyond remains poised to gain from its digital platform, which offers omni-channel services such as Buy-Online-Pick-Up-In-Store (BOPIS) and Curbside Pickup. This, in turn, is leading to customer acquisition.

Moreover, sales from its mobile app rose more than a two-fold year over year in third-quarter fiscal 2020. During the five-day holiday sale period from Thanksgiving to Cyber Monday, the company witnessed year-over-year double-digit growth in overall comps for the core U.S. Bed Bath & Beyond banner, with digital comps up roughly 69%.

For the fiscal fourth quarter, it anticipates positive sales momentum to continue in the digital platform. Encouragingly, the company introduced same-day delivery services on bedbathbeyond.com and buybuybaby.com during the said quarter. Also, it partnered with Shipt and Instacart to provide same-day delivery services to customers of Bed Bath & Beyond and buybuy BABY banners.

Apart from a solid online show, improved gross margin led to adjusted EBITDA growth, which, in turn, drove bottom-line growth in the fiscal third quarter. Notably, the company reported the second successive quarter of growth in profit. It expects adjusted EBITDA margin to be higher year over year in the fiscal fourth quarter on the back of a positive product mix, higher markdowns, better promotions as well as lower distribution and fulfillment costs. Also, fiscal 2020 adjusted EBITDA has been lifted to $500-$525 million, up from $500 million mentioned earlier.

Further, the company is on track with restructuring efforts to achieve improved profits over the next two-three years. Alongside this, the company expects SG&A savings of $85 million from the strategic actions announced in February 2020. Out of these cost savings, management intends to reinvest roughly $150-$200 million in future initiatives. Additionally, it anticipates realizing savings of nearly $150 million and $200 million, respectively, through cost-cutting actions and reduced discretionary costs as well as renegotiations with existing vendors.

As part of such streamlining efforts, the company divested many businesses, which is likely to generate annual SG&A savings of $85 million. This will then be reinvested in omni-channel transformation and to boost shareholder return. Further, the company’s store-network optimization project is likely to generate savings of nearly $100 million on an annual basis. Also, it noted that its non-core portfolio banner work is nearing completion in the fiscal fourth quarter and will position it well for a solid start to fiscal 2021.

However, COVID-related headwinds, including dismal store traffic, significant shipping constraints and increased freight expenses are anticipated to weigh on this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) company’s top line in the fiscal fourth quarter. In fact, net sales are expected to decline at a double-digit rate, with in-store traffic likely to remain drab.   ",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bed-bath-beyond-bbby-concludes-162704294.html
2021-02-02T16:24:47.000Z,There's a lot of confusion in the market about what a short seller is: Dan David,"Wolfpack Research founder Dan David joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss the risks to the overall market as the GameStop and Reddit-fueled saga continue, and why he thinks regulation is the wrong move. MYLES UDLAND: All right, let's stay on this topic and think a bit more about what it means for market structure, where we go from here in terms of regulation, how short sellers think about events like this. Dan David joins us now. He's the founder over at Wolfpack Research. And Dan, I'm just curious, as someone who likes to play on the short side of the market, how you've looked at the last couple weeks of-- Andrew left getting chased out of dodge on this thing and the narrative around shorts that has kind of developed as a result of this. DAN DAVID: Well, I think there's a lot of confusion in the market about what a short seller is, the difference between a long short fund and possibly short activist. And I really don't think the Reddit rebellion or army cares. I think what they saw, and what really doesn't get described, is that there are some very sophisticated people on that chat board. And they saw a setup with GameStop that showed, hey, look, there's really only 4 million shares we need to push around, and show 70 million shares in the flow. But between what insiders own and passive investments who aren't going to sell, they're, in fact, the ones loaning out the shares. And when they loan out those shares, short seller sells it to the market, creates a synthetic share. That's how you get to the 140%. And we're seeing that contract as that happens right now. And the stock's going down. But when you have a situation where you can really just have to push around four million shares, it's quite a different thing. As this thing opens up and there's 10, 20, 30, 40 million shares that are free trading, maybe not locked up and passive or with insiders, they're not going to be able to do that. So that's what happened.            ",https://finance.yahoo.com/video/theres-lot-confusion-market-short-162447314.html
2021-02-02T16:01:00.000Z,Short Squeeze Stockbrokers And Hedge Funds Face Proposed Antitrust Class Action,"SAN FRANCISCO, Feb. 2, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- The Joseph Saveri Law Firm filed an antitrust class action lawsuit today on behalf of a class of retail investors in federal court against 35 defendants, including Robinhood, E*TRADE, TD Ameritrade, Melvin Capital, Citadel, Sequoia Capital, and others. The plaintiffs allege that they and other retail investors continue to be injured due to a large, overarching conspiracy among the defendants to stop them from buying stocks in open and fair public securities markets. Plaintiffs contend that the purpose and effect of the scheme was to shield hedge funds, venture capitalists, and institutional investors from massive losses they had exposed themselves to due to their highly speculative short selling strategies. Plaintiffs bring claims under the federal and state antitrust laws as well as other state laws and common law. The retail investors held shares in twelve companies: GameStop (GME), AMC Theaters (AMC), American Airlines (AAL), Bed, Bath and Beyond (BBBY), Blackberry (BB), Express (EXPR), Koss (KOSS), Naked Brand Group (NAKD), Nokia (NOK), Sundial Growers Inc. (SNDL), Tootsie Roll Industries (TR), and Trivago N.V. (TRVG). Several large hedge funds and investment firms, including defendants Citadel and Melvin Capital, possessed massive ""short"" positions in these relevant securities. ""Short"" sellers borrow shares or other interests in corporate stock, securities, or other assets. In so doing, they bet that prices of the securities will decrease. If the stock prices in fact drop, a short seller buys the stock back at a lower price and returns it to the lender. The difference between the sell price and the buy price is the profit. Short sellers essentially bet on a stock's failure or decline rather than its success or increase. Retail investors correctly identified that the relevant securities were undervalued. In fact, as the plaintiffs allege, the short positions were over-leveraged as much as 140%, such that institutional investors could not close their positions. These retail investors then began purchasing ""long"" positions in these companies, driving stock prices upward, resulting in great losses to those invested in short positions.

2021-02-02T10:59:41.000Z,The retail rally is bigger than GameStop,"Tuesday, February 2, 2021 Get the Morning Brief sent directly to your inbox every Monday to Friday by 6:30 a.m. ET. Subscribe At the bottom of the GameStop/Reddit/Robinhood retail trading saga sits one important question: What does it all mean for markets going forward? As Sam Ro highlighted in Monday’s Morning Brief, initial indications from big investors are that it’s too early to tell. A survey conducted by Deutsche Bank last week revealed a split, noncommittal view from 700 of the firm’s clients. But whether retail investors can hang with the market’s heavy hitters appears to have a better answer. And that answer is yes. In a note to clients published over the weekend, David Kostin and the equity strategy team at Goldman Sachs highlighted that since the March 2020 low, retail investors have outperformed both the broader market as well as hedge fund investors. And handily. “A basket of retail favorites has returned +17% YTD and +179% since the March 2020 low, outperforming both the S&P 500 (+72%) and our Hedge Fund VIP list of the most popular hedge fund long positions (+106%),” Kostin writes. Of course, last week’s Main Street-led squeeze in names like GameStop (GME), AMC (AMC), Bed, Bath & Beyond (BBBY), among others, is a partial driver of these returns. But short squeezes, as Kostin notes, are not new. It’s just not common that they’re as extreme as what’s broken out in this market. And rarely are retail traders swept up in this kind of action. “The past 25 years have witnessed a number of sharp short squeezes in the U.S. equity market, but none as extreme as has occurred recently,” Kostin writes. “One key difference between the typical short squeeze and the recent rally in heavily-shorted stocks is the degree of involvement of retail traders, who also appear to have catalyzed sharp moves in other parts of the market. “Last week we discussed the surging trading activity and share prices of penny stocks, firms with negative earnings, and extremely high-growth, high-multiple stocks. These trends have all accompanied a large increase in online broker trading activity.”          ",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/retail-favorite-stocks-outperforming-morning-brief-105941581.html

2021-02-01T20:35:15.000Z,Short squeeze explained: Yahoo U,"For more business and finance explainers, check out our Yahoo U page. Volatile price moves in beaten-down stocks like GameStop (GME) and AMC (AMC) are grabbing national attention and introducing a bevy of wonky trading terms into the popular lexicon. Discussions in Reddit forums, such as Wall Street Bets, are now dinner table fodder. And it all started last week with surging prices in a basket of stocks — a classic “short squeeze.” The modern stock market — an intricate web of interconnected exchanges where buyers and sellers meet — is at its heart simply a collection of auction markets. Price moves are explained by supply and demand. Companies issue shares to investors and employees, which may be held or traded. The so-called “shares outstanding” (about 70 million for GameStop) is an upper limit on the supply. But a more useful metric is the shares available for trading at any given time called the “float.” This doesn’t include shares that are effectively being held long term and not available for trading. According to Yahoo Finance data, GameStop’s float is estimated to be 47 million shares. But the actual number of total shares available for trading is likely quite lower. In a typical rally, large institutional investors accumulate stock during a consolidation phase, eating up the supply shares. After a time, the trading float gets low enough that incremental purchases at the margin start moving the price more. Usually, there’s a catalyst, such as an earnings release, which sets the stage for a dramatic breakout due to increased interest and demand. The recent breakout in Microsoft (MSFT) from a seven-month consolidation after its Jan. 26 earnings announcement is an excellent example. In a short squeeze, the dynamics are a bit different. Large institutional investors are more likely to be short a stock, and the resulting pop can be much more violent due to supply and demand. To short a stock, a hedge fund or retail trader needs to locate it to borrow with the help of a broker. For a fee, the trader borrows the stock and is legally allowed to sell short the stock — betting on lower prices from which to buy the stock, thus “covering” or closing out the position. The bigger the short position, the bigger the potential surge.                           ",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/short-squeeze-explained-yahoo-u-203515440.html

[MUSIC PLAYING] ALEXIS CHRISTOFOROUS: For more on the Robinhood GameStop saga, I want to bring in Sinan Aral. He is a professor at MIT and author of ""The Hype Machine."" Sinan, good to have you here. You wrote a great op-ed in ""The Washington Post""-- I'd encourage people to check it out-- about the herd mentality of social media and how it's bleeding over into the real world like never before. What are some of the long-term implications of that, do you think? SINAN ARAL: Well, I think what we're seeing is the rise of the crowd's power in a number of different spheres in our society simultaneously. We saw it in the election, the aftermath of the election, where information flowing over social media was able to coordinate an insurrection, a riot, on the Capitol. And this was after we even had warning signs when there was a plot to kidnap and kill the governor of Michigan. Now we see crowds that are raising again a coordinated effort to drive up the price of a stock. And let me be absolutely clear. I do not mean to draw an analogy between the GameStop stock price and the Capitol riot to say that there's even anything nefarious going on in the GameStop situation. It may be that nothing illegal was done at all in the GameStop situation. But the similarity is that when information moves so quickly and can coordinate so many people so fast, it scales the crowd's power like we've never seen before. And that is the similarity between the two. ALEXIS CHRISTOFOROUS: You, know this isn't the first time, though, right, Sinan, that we've seen social media sort of inflate stock prices, create bubbles. We've seen pump and dump schemes happen on social media with misinformation and fake tweets and fake posts on Facebook. So why was the GameStop situation different? SINAN ARAL: Well, I think a couple of things. So certainly in the past, when we've had misinformation used to pump stocks and then dump them, the SEC investigated and actually brought charges in those cases back in 2017, back in 2013 and '14. There were companies like [INAUDIBLE] and Dreamworks that were indicted by the SEC based on pump and dump schemes over social media.

The Bed Bath & Beyond Analyst: Bradley Thomas downgrades Bed Bath & Beyond's stock from Sector Weight to Underweight, while establishing a price target of $24. The Bed Bath & Beyond Thesis: The company has been underperforming amid stiff competition in the home furnishings industry, Thomas said in the note. “This year, BBBY continued to underperform peers, as the Company only saw comp growth of 5.5% and 2.4% in 2Q20 and 3Q20, respectively, during arguably the best backdrop we have seen for the industry in 20 years of following Home Furnishings. While new management is working diligently to improve the merchandising and marketing strategy, we expect competition to remain intense,” he wrote. “To be clear, we think highly of CEO Mark Tritton and his team and their turnaround plan,” the analyst said.

Joining us, old friend Steve Sosnick. He's the chief strategist over at Interactive Brokers. Steve, where do you want to start with this whole thing? Because the story seems every day to kind of change, and what we know, what we think we know, what it means, what it doesn't. As we sit here today, what's your biggest takeaway so far from this entire Robinhood, Reddit short squeeze saga? STEVE SOSNICK: Well, first of all, good to see you, Myles, on a snowy Monday. It's a very tough takeaway because there's so many moving parts here. I guess my biggest thought is it's not-- there's not-- nothing that's that new about this. There have been short squeezes ever since there have been shorts. There have been manias even before that, probably. And what I think the difference now is it's the nature of it. And in each different bubble or mania, whatever, the methodology-- the methodology changes. We're not getting tulip bulbs from Turkey this time, we're getting stocks that had been left for dead in the malls now. And well, actually, that was last week, and now we're finding silver stocks that, you know-- it's the silver that's in grandma's attic is now what's rallying. It changes, but I think the difference is, you know, it's moving faster and in a bigger way because of technological changes, the changes in social media. We're not using Yahoo and AOL message boards that we did in 1999. We're using-- we're using Reddit and other forms. It's an older game, it's just-- it just changes form every so often. - And Steve, it's good to see you. It's Julie here. So do you think that the Redditors' reported sort of ire at Wall Street or, you know, feeling like the system is stacked against them, do you think that that is misplaced? Is that similar to some of the manias that we've seen in the past also?                       ",https://finance.yahoo.com/video/reddit-fueled-saga-very-poor-163039836.html

MYLES UDLAND: But of course, the big story remains everything that is going on with the retail trade, GameStop, Robin Hood, sort of pick your poster child here, silver star of the show this morning. But over the weekend, Yahoo Finance Editor in Chief Andy Serwer, wrote about the five big trends that this mania or this event really speaks to. And so, Andy, let's start with one of them, which is populism. And I think that, I'm curious how you see that unfolding, because everyone can kind of apply their own populist lens to this event. And I think any spin that people have on it really leads down some fascinating roads. ANDY SERWER: Yeah, I think that's right, Myles. I mean, the bottom line is here that retail investors were always sort of the joke on Wall Street, and they were always wrong. But part of this phenomena is that retail investors are right. They're driving these stocks up and encouraging their friends to get in, and then they're making money. Of course, how long's this going to last? The other line I heard someone say was from a hedge fund person, was that 2020 was a bad year for humans and a great year for finance. Well, guess who's taking revenge right now? And I think the WSB people, you know, this is not a secret, but they're feeling all these years of being maligned by the system. And that they are sort of getting their torches and their axes and sort of storming the castle. And in a way, they are sort of parallel to the Bernie and Trump people. You don't want to take that too far, because there's obviously not an equivalent between storming the capitol and picking up on a short hedge fund, but people are discontent with elites in America, you guys. JULIE HYMAN: Yeah, they are. Although ironically, on this trade, I mean, there are certainly hedge funds on their side of the trade also, and with the silver trade as well. Citadel Securities is one of the biggest longs on the silver ETF that the Redditors now seem to be buying. But you mentioned the sort of political connection here. And this is something that this has reminded me of as well, the sort of populist trend that we have seen in politics. So what are some of the parallels that you're watching there?

2021-02-01T13:51:06.000Z,Robinhood in a tough position as it faces a wave of lawsuits over GameStop saga,"Since the Robinhood mobile trading app temporarily blocked its customers from buying stock in GameStop (GME), AMC (AMC) Entertainment, and 11 other companies last Thursday, it has been hit with at least 33 federal lawsuits across the country. Filed in 10 states, including California, Florida, Illinois, and New York, most seek class action status and allege violations of securities laws or consumer protection statutes. Four securities law experts — a big-firm, defense-side litigator and three law professors — expressed widely divergent views about the suits’ viability. The diversity of their perspectives reflects, in part, our still murky understandings of precisely what led Robinhood Financial to take the controversial step. Robinhood’s shocking action Thursday was the culmination of an unprecedented, snowballing, populist assault on hedge funds. A throng of anti-Wall Street, day traders — self-organized on social media and empowered by Robinhood’s commission-free app — were forcing artificial spikes in the prices of lackluster stocks that hedge funds were betting on going down. The price of GameStop, for instance — a chain of brick-and-mortar video game retailers struggling to stay relevant in a world where games are increasingly downloaded directly from the web — rose more than 1600% in January. But the sudden trading restrictions Robinhood imposed Thursday infuriated its customers and raised legal issues. “I think Robinhood is in a difficult position here,” says James D. Cox, a securities law scholar at Duke University School of Law. Causing customers to “miss out on an opportunity to buy stock in a company that was maybe going up to $1000,” he says, is a serious issue. It raises questions about whether Robinhood met its duty to provide “fair, just and equitable” treatment to all customers. “I’m hoping FINRA opens up an investigation here,” continues Cox, referring to the Financial Industry Regulatory Association, a non-governmental watchdog overseen by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

Click to skip ahead and see Candlestick Capital's Top 5 Stock Holdings. Candlestick Capital Management, founded by former Citadel portfolio manager Jack Woodruff, is among the hedge fund losers in a tug of war with Reddit’s day traders. The hedge fund, which started fiscal 2021 with almost $3 billion, fell at a low- to mid-teens range on its short bets for the year through Wednesday. The losses came after the firm has generated annual returns of 26% in 2020, thanks to its positions in consumer discretionary and consumer staples stocks. Several other hedge funds including Steve Cohen Point72 and Dan Sundheim’s D1 Capital have also lost significantly amid a buying frenzy fueled by retail day traders. Along with other stocks, GameStop was among the main focus of Reddit’s WallStreetBets crew over the past couple of weeks. Other prominent short squeezed stocks include BlackBerry (NYSE:BB), AMC Entertainment (AMC) Express (EXPR), Bed Bath & Beyond (BBBY), Koss (KOSS), and Nokia (NOK). Hedge funds have also started closing their positions despite losses as shares of short squeezed stocks are not cooling off. Citron Research's Andrew Left, for instance, stated on Wednesday that the firm has closed most of its short position at a loss of 100% when GameStop's stock traded around $90. One of the most well-known short bets investment firms Melvin Capital Management, which received a huge emergency cash injection of $2.75 billion from Steven Cohen, Ken Griffin, and other partners, is down 30% year to date due to its short bets on GameStop and other stocks. Reddit's army has particularly targeted short bets of former star portfolio manager for Steven A. Cohen, Gabriel Plotkin.

2021-01-30T13:07:01.000Z,"How the tale of Reddit, GameStop, Robinhood is really about 5 big trends","What happened this week with GameStop (GME), Reddit and Robinhood was shocking, unprecedented and unforeseen. Lost in the flurry though is that the craziness is very much a part of some elephant-in-the-room trends in this country. I’ll explain what I mean in a moment, but first let me give you the bare bones of the story which includes everyone from Elon Musk to Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, as well as hedge fund titans and the New York Mets. Here’s the precis: Over the past several weeks, a group of investors, often communicating on a Reddit community called Wall Street Bets, (WSB)—which has 6 million members and describes itself as “Like 4chan found a Bloomberg terminal illness”—bought shares in GameStop, the beaten down video game retailer. Why? A few saw promise in the company, but recently, mostly because word had gotten out that hedge fund Melvin Capital, among others, had shorted the stock (betting it would go down.) That the belief that they could make the stock go “to the moon” (how WSBers put it.) As demand for GameStop’s stock rose, (these investors bought options as well), so did its price, creating “a short squeeze,” which forces those who bet against the shares to buy in order to forestall bigger losses, sending the stock price even higher. But something else was going on too. These newly-empowered investors insisted they were sending short sellers, hedge funds and Wall Street writ large, a message. They were tired of being on the wrong end of the proverbial investment stick. In other words this wasn’t just investing, it was about torches and pitchforks. “It makes me think of Occupy Wall Street, in this case instead of protesting corporate greed, they were given the tools to participate in it,” says Doug Boneparth, president of wealth management firm, Bone Fide Wealth. These investors had figured out a Wall Street pain point: Ganging up on short sellers. And this group made war on shorts who had positions in other companies too such as AMC (AMC), BlackBerry (BB), Nokia (NOK), and Bed Bath & Beyond (BBBY).

Frenkel, Dickinson Wright Chair and former senior counsel in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s division of enforcement. Frenkel told Yahoo Finance Live that “the SEC should have used its trading suspension authority,” even if it was an aggressive approach, several days ago. “GameStop blew through New York Stock Exchange circuit breakers 10 times over 2 trading days,” he said. “So that meant that the circuit breakers alone were not sufficient.” On Thursday, Robinhood and other online brokerage firms restricted trading on shares of GameStop, AMC (AMC) and other equities. Following a class action lawsuit and calls for congressional hearings, Robinhood announced it would allow limited buys of these stocks on Friday. “I’m not here to advocate for longs for shorts for the small investors or for the institutional investors but really try and call it from my objective perspective as possible,” said Frenkel. “To me it does not matter if we’re talking about shorts or the longs,” he added. “If a participant in the market is putting out materially false information for the purpose of driving the price of a stock, that is stock manipulation.” On Friday the SEC said in a statement it is monitoring the extreme price volatility. “The Commission will closely review actions taken by regulated entities that may disadvantage investors or otherwise unduly inhibit their ability to trade certain securities,” read the statement. “What you’re going to see is a scrutiny brought to bear on the broader activity here in terms of whether it’s the institutions ... whose obligation fundamentally is to act in the best interest of the customers and the markets,” said Frenkel. The SEC “does need to figure out, are we moving into an era where corporate fundamentals are becoming less relevant?” he added. Ines covers the U.S. stock market.

Shares of some of the heavily shorted stocks that had become popular picks among members of Reddit’s r/wallstreetbets forum surged anew after sliding on Thursday. GameStop (GME) shares rocketed higher by about 70% on Friday after nearly halving on Thursday. The stock closed at $65.01 per share a week ago, but by Friday’s close, was higher by more than 400% to $328.24 per share. Shares of AMC (AMC) also soared Friday after plunging on Thursday, as did shares of BlackBerry (BB), Express (EXPR), Bed Bath & Beyond (BBBY) and Nokia (NOK). Over the course of this week, trading in these and other heavily shorted names generated historic trading volumes in equity markets, surpassing even the volume of trades taking place at the most volatile points of the pandemic in 2020. More than 23.6 billion shares of U.S.-traded stocks were exchanged on Wednesday this week, according to Bloomberg data, marking the most ever in records spanning back more than a decade. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) said Friday it was “closely monitoring and evaluating the extreme price volatility of certain stocks’ trading prices over the past several days,” according to a statement. A day earlier, online brokerages including Robinhood, Webull Financial and E-Trade Financial blocked buying of many of these volatile shares, drawing the ire of users, criticism from lawmakers and a class action lawsuit against Robinhood for the trading restrictions. Elsewhere, recent reports on U.S. economic activity came in better than expected, pointing to a tentative improvement in the economic landscape as investors await widespread vaccinations and lasting business reopenings. Weekly unemployment claims dipped below 900,000 for the first time in three weeks, albeit while remaining at a historically elevated level. And on Friday, new data showed that personal income rose more than expected in December, while consumer spending ticked down less than feared.

2021-01-29T17:57:23.000Z,"An overpriced market is nobody's friend, says finance professor of GameStop Saga","James Angel, associate professor of finance at Georgetown University’s McDonough School of Business, joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss why the Reddit-driven stock rally is a classic battle between bulls and bears. MYLES UDLAND: Let's stay on this topic and talk a bit more about market structure, what this means, what it doesn't, where we go from here. James Angel's associate professor of finance at Georgetown University's McDonough School of Business. Jim, great to speak with you this morning. You have heard us talking. And I'd just love to start with your thoughts on the situation as we know it today and how you've been thinking about this saga just throughout the week. I'm sorry. Jim, you're still muted. You'll have to unmute. JAMES ANGEL: This is a fascinating battle between the bulls and the bears. And we've had these battles for centuries. They're always very colorful. The longs and the shorts have very different narratives, and it's always fun to watch. So basically, fire up the popcorn and enjoy the battle. But it's also demonstrating some blemishes in our market structure. I could get into technical details, but when we see these price spikes that push a price far beyond a reasonable level, it's not doing anybody any good. An overpriced market is nobody's friend, because all it does is set up everyone for future losses. So we need to be asking ourselves, what can we do better to make sure that stock prices reflect economic fundamentals? JULIE HYMAN: So I guess, Jim, what can we do better? What do you make of the whole democratization idea, right? I mean, isn't it, in theory, a good thing if more people have access to the market, right? But at the same time, we have seen some of the dangers of that because-- but there is this whole narrative of, like, the little guy working against this big system that is stacked against him. JAMES ANGEL: I love the democratization. And some people go, oh, these people don't know what they're doing. Oh, they're gambling. Well, most people aren't really skilled day traders, just like most people are not good at playing soccer. Only a few thousand people in the planet are good enough at playing soccer to play it professionally.

2021-01-29T17:25:39.000Z,Webull CEO explains why trading was restricted amid the GameStop market mania,"As trading of GameStop (GME) got wilder on Thursday, Robinhood, Interactive Brokers, and Webull shut down the buying feature for the beleaguered video game retailer’s stock. The move has been roundly bashed by politicians on the left and right and caused a wave of anger towards Wall Street for supposedly rigging the system against individual retail investors, and specifically Robinhood for abandoning its core beliefs of “democratizing finance.” But in an interview with Yahoo Finance, Webull CEO Anthony Denier explained that the situation was not an unsavory conspiracy against traders who had made money from the so-called short squeeze on GameStop. “There is an outcry because a lot of the retail, they don't actually understand the dynamics that happen after a trade,” Denier said. “It has nothing to do with the decision or some sort of closed room smoke-filled cigar room of Wall Street firms getting together to the dismay of the retail trader. This has to do with settlement mechanics of the market.” The market for GameStop became unsettled this month after activist investor Ryan Cohen, the founder of Chewy, secured a seat on the retailer’s board of directors. GameStop’s stock soared as he stepped up his efforts to transform the company, and soon members of a Reddit group called Wall Street Bets began buying up shares in the game retailer. Soon, investors betting against the stock — which had faced trouble amid a shift to digital video games — had to buy the stock too, to cover their losses. The stock went from $65 a share at market close on Friday, Jan. 22 to close at $347.51 the following Wednesday. That’s when the three online brokerages stepped in to put the brakes on the buying. For Webull, this was not a nanny move to protect investors from buying at the top and then getting mad nor was it a move to save the hedge funds that were shorting GameStop, Denier said. “Our clearing firm simply cannot afford the cost to settle those trades,” he said.
