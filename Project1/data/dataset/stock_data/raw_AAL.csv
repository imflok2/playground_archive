2021-06-08T11:09:33.000Z,Test flights for superfast jets will 'be in the air in just a matter of months': Boom Supersonic CEO,"Boom Supersonic, the company building United Airlines' (UAL) faster than the speed of sound jet, promises to start flying passengers in 2029.  ""We have already built and rolled out history's first independently developed supersonic jet, the XB-1,"" Boom CEO Blake Scholl told Yahoo Finance Live. United announced, last week, it had entered into a $3 billion deal with Boom to purchase 15 of Boom's supersonic airliners, called Overture, at a cost of $200 million each. The jet is designed to carry up to 88 people.   ""We are excited to be delivering Overture to passengers in this decade,"" Scholl said. But the Overture supersonic jet has yet to take off the ground and still only exists on the drawing table. Boom's prototype experimental aircraft called the XB-1 will start test flights later this year. ""That's our prototype for the Overture airliner. It rolled out last fall and it's going to be in the air in just a matter of months,"" Scholl said. The goal is to roll out the first Overture jet in 2025 and begin test flights in 2026. The Overture supersonic passenger jet will also be the first commercial aircraft to be carbon neutral, the first day it takes flight. The plane's engines will be powered by sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), which is derived from cooking oil. The SAF will allow the Overture to hit speeds around mach 1.7, twice as fast as today's passenger jets, without polluting the atmosphere. ""We've already run XB-1's engines on one of the highest blends of alternative fuels ever used,"" Scholl said, adding that test results for XB-1 engines, powered by sustainable fuel, showed greater performance than current jet fuel blends. ""So that means that the airplane that you most want to be on, from a speed and comfort and convenience perspective, is also the one that's the best for the planet. And that's really, really exciting,"" Scholl said.

2021-06-08T16:39:04.000Z,"Airline Stock Roundup: DAL's Bullish Q2 Revenue Update, GOL's Traffic & More","With air-travel demand for leisure on an upswing in the United States, management at Delta Air Lines DAL gave an improved outlook for the June-quarter revenues. Also, riding on this bullish sentiment surrounding air-travel demand, American Airlines AAL authorities stated that its seven-day moving average of net bookings (as of Jun 2) was approximately 90% of the level in the comparable period of 2019. Notably, United Airlines UAL and Hawaiian Holdings HA had issued upbeat updates for the second quarter owing to betterment in air-travel demand as discussed in detail in the previous week’s writeup. In another encouraging development, Brazilian carrier Gol Linhas’ GOL May traffic surged 65% from its April reading as the increased rate of vaccinations prompts people to opt for more air travel. 1.At the Bernstein Strategic Decisions Conference, Delta, currently carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), predicted second-quarter revenues (on an adjusted basis) in the $6-6.2 billion range, indicating a 50-52% decline from the second-quarter 2019 actuals. However, this suggests an improvement from the past guidance issued in April, which had projected a 50-55% decline. Owing to the uptick in air-travel demand, load factor (% of seats filled by passengers) and yields are also showing signs of recovery throughout the June quarter. Adding to this optimism, Delta anticipates domestic leisure travel in the current month to be more than 100% restored from the 2019 actuals. Pre-tax loss for the second quarter is now expected in the $1-$1.2 billion range, which again betters the previous estimate of $1-$1.5 billion. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here. 2.In an SEC filing dated Jun 3, management at American Airlines stated that its domestic load factor in May was around 84% and greater than 88% over the Memorial Day holiday. The airline expects the “strength in bookings to continue through the end of the second quarter and into the third quarter”, provided current demand trends sustain. Moreover, it anticipates “leisure yields to approach or exceed the corresponding 2019 levels during the peak summer travel period.” On a further positive note, American Airlines is seeing a gradual increase in demand among small- and medium-sized enterprises, and some large corporate customers, although business travel demand continues to be suppressed.

2021-06-07T15:52:12.000Z,Airline CEOs urge U.S. and UK to 'open the skies',"CEOs from the largest airlines in the U.S. and U.K. urged regulators in both countries Monday to reopen transatlantic travel.   ""Throughout the pandemic, experts have encouraged governments, businesses and the public to follow the science. United and other airlines have done just that,"" said United Airlines (UAL) CEO Scott Kirby. Kirby and other airline executives held a press conference this morning to make the case to reopen what is called the UK-U.S. travel corridor. They called on British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and President Joe Biden to ""open the skies"" during their meeting at the G-7 this coming weekend. ""The millions of travel supported U.S. jobs lost to the pandemic cannot be replaced without the return of international visitors, and the UK is our number one overseas travel market,"" according to U.S. Travel Association President and CEO Roger Dow. Prior to the pandemic, there were more than 30 flights daily between London and U.S. destinations. The association says restricting international travel will cost the U.S. economy $325 billion and more than 1 million jobs by the end of 2021. The United States has barred nearly all non-U.S. citizens who have been in the UK within the last 14 days from entering the country since March 2020. And, most U.S. travelers visiting the UK must quarantine for 10 days upon arrival. Shai Weiss, the CEO of Virgin Atlantic, said the, ""Overly cautious approach fails to reap the benefits of the successful vaccination programs in both the UK and the U.S."" ""Nobody wants to go to Europe to stay in their hotel room for a week or be under quarantine,"" airline industry analyst Bob Harrell told Yahoo Finance last month. The airlines are calling on regulators to lift entry requirements for UK travelers who can provide a negative COVID-19 test ahead of their arriving in the U.S or present proof they have been fully vaccinated. On the U.K. side they are asking British Prime Minister Boris Johnson to consider easing the testing requirements for travelers entering the UK.

The bosses of all airlines that offer UK-US flights and Heathrow Airport issued a joint call for a trans-Atlantic travel ""corridor"" on Monday. The group said it would be ""essential to igniting economic recovery"" in a statement. Nearly all passengers from the UK are currently banned from travelling to the US. Where is on the green list for holiday travel? Travel sector 'frustrated' over rule changes Under a presidential decree introduced last March, non-US citizens who have been in the UK in the last 14 days cannot enter the country unless a specific exemption applies. Meanwhile, travellers from the US to the UK must self-isolate for 10 days on arrival as the country is on the ""amber list"". But airline bosses argued on Monday that because of the speed of the vaccine roll-out in both countries, travel should be allowed to resume. Shai Weiss, the boss of Virgin Atlantic, said: ""There is no reason for the US to be absent from the UK green list. This overly cautious approach fails to reap the benefits of the successful vaccination programmes in both the UK and the US."" Adding the US to the green list would remove the need for quarantine on return to the UK. Passengers would, however, still need to have proof of a negative Covid test result on departure. ""Customers, families and businesses need to book and travel with confidence. After 15 months of restrictions, the time to act is now,"" Mr Weiss added. John Holland-Kaye, chief executive of Heathrow Airport, said: ""Connectivity between the UK and the US is one of the great engines of the global economy."" In a statement, the group estimated that UK businesses are losing £23m each day that trans-Atlantic trade links remain closed ""The scientific data shows transatlantic travel and trade can be reopened safely and every day that policymakers delay puts jobs, livelihoods and the economic chances of hardworking folks across our countries at risk unnecessarily,"" said Mr Holland-Kaye.

""The country will welcome vaccinated travelers beginning June 9 without quarantine requirements,"" according to a Delta press release: ""Passengers must provide proof that they are fully vaccinated with a vaccine approved by the European Medicines Agency as well as present a negative COVID test upon arrival (less than 72 hours for a PCR test or less than 48 hours for an antigen test).""

The extra leg room seats are already sold out. Delta and its partner airlines currently fly to Croatia, France, Greece, Italy, Iceland and Spain.  United Airlines (UAL) flies to those destinations too. The same trip to Paris, leaving from Newark International Airport, will cost you $836 in the main cabin. United added flights to Spain back in April and a round-trip flight to Madrid on those July dates would cost you $822 in the main cabin while Delta is selling those tickets for $664. Flying American Airlines (AAL) to Paris, on those dates from New York, costs $1,200 in the main cabin. But flying from American's Dallas airport hub would only cost $686 in the main cabin. American's main cabin fare from New York to Madrid is $821 but only $671 in basic economy class. United CEO Scott Kirby said international travel used to be a third of United's business but most destinations remain closed. ""And as they're starting to open, we see huge demand,"" Kirby told the Annual Bernstein Strategic Decisions Conference.

David Ige last week laid out a step-by-step plan to lift COVID-19-related travel protocols. Starting June 15, all restrictions on inter-county travel will end and fully-vaccinated residents who received their COVID-19 shots in Hawaii will be able to travel back to the state without the need to get a pre-travel test or quarantine, Ige announced. Kent Nishimura/Los Angeles Times via Getty Images Later, when Hawaii reaches a 60% vaccination rate, the state will lift pre-arrival testing and quarantine requirements for domestic U.S. travelers who were vaccinated in the country. Travelers will have to show proof of their vaccination through the state's Safe Travels program. When Hawaii hits a 70% vaccination rate, the state will lift all travel restrictions and officially end its Safe Travels program, Ige said. ""The easing of travel restrictions is a direct result of our robust vaccination rate, and a community that sacrificed and did what it had to do over the past year and a half to stop the spread of COVID-19,"" Ige said in a statement. ""We need to push hard now so we can get to the point where Safe Travels is no longer needed to keep the people of Hawai'i safe."" So far, about 59% of Hawaii's population has received at least one dose of a vaccine and about 52% have been fully vaccinated, according to Hawaii's Department of Health. That's higher than the country overall where 51.5% of the population has received at least one dose and 41.9% are fully vaccinated, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Currently, Hawaii-bound travelers can skip quarantine if they get tested before traveling at a ""trusted partner"" site. Fully vaccinated residents of Hawaii who are hopping from island to island are also exempt from testing and quarantine requirements thanks to the state's inter-island vaccine passport.

2021-06-04T15:47:03.000Z,American Airlines (AAL) Slips Despite Upbeat May Bookings,"American Airlines Group AAL has witnessed continued improvement in bookings as more Americans get vaccinated and return to the skies. The airline stated that its seven-day moving average of net bookings (as of Jun 2) was approximately 90% of the level in the comparable period of 2019.

Despite this bullish sentiment, the company did not make commensurate improvements in its second-quarter guidance issued in April. This might have played on investors’ minds, causing shares of American Airlines to decline 3.4% at the close of business on Jun 3.

In a SEC filing dated Jun 3, the carrier stated that its domestic load factor (percentage of seats filled with passengers) in May was around 84% and greater than 88% over the Memorial Day holiday. The airline expects the “strength in bookings to continue through the end of the second quarter and into the third quarter”, provided current demand trends sustain. Moreover, it anticipates “leisure yields to approach or exceed the corresponding 2019 levels during the peak summer travel period.” American Airlines Group Inc. price | American Airlines Group Inc. Quote  On a further positive note, American Airlines is seeing gradual increase in demand among small- and medium-sized enterprises, and some large corporate customers, although business travel demand continues to be suppressed.

Thanks to strong summer bookings, American Airlines, that has burned millions of dollars in cash since the pandemic began, finally generated cash in May. It expects a liquidity of more than $20 billion at the end of the second quarter, compared with its previous guidance of $19.5 billion.

American Airlines maintains its second-quarter system capacity (total available seat miles) forecast at a decline of 20-25% from the comparable 2019 level. Additionally, total revenues are still anticipated to fall approximately 40% from the 2019 level. American Airlines carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

The U.S. airline industry was almost at the brink of collapse as the pandemic shut down borders and people stayed confined to their homes last year. This, however, seems to be changing as restrictions continue to get eased and the economy further reopens. Although the road to recovery is long and tough, the process seems to have started as millions of Americans appear a bit confident with the vaccination drive in full swing. Given this scenario, this summer could prove to be a great one for the U.S. airlines industry, with ticket sales and traffic already pickling up. With almost 50% of Americans above the age of 18 having received at least one dose of the COVID-19 vaccine, people are a lot more confident. This has also seen the Centers for Disease Control and Preventions (CDC) easing restrictions. Fully vaccinated people are now no longer required to wear marks indoors or outdoors. The CDC has also revised its travel guidelines. Although people need to wear masks while flying, those who are fully vaccinated or have recovered from COVID-19 in the past three months, no longer need to get tested or self-quarantine upon traveling. The past few weeks have already seen airlines getting busier as more people are booking tickets and traveling. According to a Simply Flying report, the Transportation Security Administration witnessed a whopping 1.85 million passengers flying across the United States on May 16.

American Airlines (AAL) was expected to receive a new Dreamliner this week. However, the delivery cannot be fulfilled by Boeing until next week at the earliest. The delay follows a recent 5-month suspension in deliveries of aircraft due to production issues. Last year, a review of Boeing’s Dreamliner production was initiated by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), which has increased scrutiny of the company’s 737 MAX manufacturing operations following earlier factory slip-ups. The FAA recently requested more information about the company’s proposed solution for addressing previously identified quality lapses. (See Boeing stock analysis on TipRanks) Boeing told the WSJ that it is working in a speedily and transparent manner to give out the details. The company is required to prove that its inspection method, which is time-consuming and labor-intensive, adheres to the federal safety regulations. Last month, Boeing CEO David Calhoun revealed plans to deliver 10-12 Dreamliners every month. With the recent development, the company will most likely miss that target. The delivery halt could bring further pressure on the company’s finances since customers usually pay most of the aircraft’s price on receipt of the aircraft. On May 25, Morgan Stanley analyst Kristine Liwag maintained a Buy rating and a price target of $274 (10.9% upside potential) on the stock. Liwag believes that 737 aircraft are flying at an increasing number of airlines both in the U.S. and internationally. He added, “Airlines have shown some improvement in the number of flights following the grounding of 737 MAX planes in April. WoW, AAL had an increase of 29% while UAL had an increase of 46%.” Overall, the stock has a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 7 Buys and 7 Holds. The average analyst price target of $270 implies 9.3% upside potential from current levels. Shares of Boeing have jumped 63.2% over the past year.

You can skip our detailed analysis of these American tourist attractions, and go directly to the Top 5 Places to Visit in the US. The US is one of the top travel destinations for people planning their vacations. The country has a lot to offer to tourists, including snow-covered peaks, beaches, redwood forests, and sumptuous cuisines. Especially in peak travel times, the country is brimming with international and domestic tourists. According to the data from International Trade Administration, over 19.4 million international visitors traveled to the U.S. in 2020 despite the coronavirus crisis. Effects of Covid-19 on Tourism in the U.S. Though the travel and tourism industry in the U.S. is always blooming, the impact of Covid-19 caused a deep dent in this sector. U.S.-based airlines suffered a whopping loss of $35 billion in 2020. American Airlines Group Inc. (NASDAQ: AAL) posted an annual loss of $8.9 billion, with a net loss of $2.8 billion in Q4. Moreover, the share price of American Airlines Group Inc. (NASDAQ: AAL) lost 45%, which is the biggest percentage decline since its merger with US Airways. Another major carrier, Delta Air Lines, Inc. (NYSE: DAL), posted a loss of $12.4 billion in 2020. United Airlines Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: UAL) reported a $7.1 billion loss for the year 2020. This loss also took away the jobs of thousands of employees working in these airline companies. Nearly 50,000 airline workers were laid off from their jobs in 2020. United Airlines Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: UAL) warned nearly a third of its staff about potential furloughs. The closure of borders for safety reasons was the main reason that international travel suffered the sharpest decline. The numbers from UN World Tourism Organization (UNWTO), compiled by McKinsey & Company, show that international tourist arrivals declined between 58 percent and 78 percent in 2020. The decline was not only witnessed in the international visitors, but the overall tourism and travel industry also suffered heavy losses. According to the U.S. Travel Association, the U.S. travel economy lost over $492 billion between March and December 2020.

2021-05-28T12:18:12.000Z,Can US Airlines Bounce Back in Summer as Restrictions Ease?,"The U.S. airline industry was almost at the brink of collapse as the pandemic shut down borders and people stayed confined to their homes last year. This, however, seems to be changing as restrictions continue to get eased and the economy further reopens. Although the road to recovery is long and tough, the process seems to have started as millions of Americans appear a bit confident with the vaccination drive in full swing. Given this scenario, this summer could prove to be a great one for the U.S. airlines industry, with ticket sales and traffic already pickling up. With almost 50% of Americans above the age of 18 having received at least one dose of the COVID-19 vaccine, people are a lot more confident. This has also seen the Centers for Disease Control and Preventions (CDC) easing restrictions. Fully vaccinated people are now no longer required to wear marks indoors or outdoors. The CDC has also revised its travel guidelines. Although people need to wear masks while flying, those who are fully vaccinated or have recovered from COVID-19 in the past three months, no longer need to get tested or self-quarantine upon traveling. The past few weeks have already seen airlines getting busier as more people are booking tickets and traveling. According to a Simply Flying report, the Transportation Security Administration witnessed a whopping 1.85 million passengers flying across the United States on May 16. If the trend continues, airline companies are likely to see a great summer. Although many countries are still struggling to manage the rising COVID-19 cases, a number of others are relaxing restrictions, thanks to the vaccination drive adopted by them. These countries are gradually lifting bans on international travel. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) has also predicted that air travel will rebound this year. IATA also predicts domestic travel to pick up as restrictions get eased further. IATA predicts domestic travel to recover by up to 96% of the pre-crisis levels by the second half of 2021, improving 48% year over year.

2021-05-28T11:04:26.000Z,Boeing Slips On Report Delivery Of 787 Dreamliner Faces New Delays,"By Dhirendra Tripathi Investing – Boeing (NYSE:BA) shares fell nearly 2% Friday on a WSJ report that said the jet maker had halted deliveries of its 787 Dreamliner planes as regulators have asked for more information on its proposed solutions to previously identified quality issues. The U.S. plane maker's 737 MAX and 787 have been afflicted by electrical and other issues since late last year, and it only resumed deliveries of the 787s in March after a five-month hiatus. ""Boeing still needs to show that its proposed inspection method would meet FAA’s federal safety regulations. The FAA is waiting for additional data from Boeing before determining whether the company’s solution meets safety regulations,"" the FAA said in a statement, according to Reuters. American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) was slated to receive a Dreamliner this week, but that delivery isn’t expected until at least next week now, the WSJ report said. The latest setback is likely to delay Boeing CEO David Calhoun’s plan to deliver 10 to 12 Dreamliners every month.

ADAM SHAPIRO: I'll date myself with this reference, but it was the Go-Gos who sang, ""Vacation, All I Ever Wanted,"" right? Millions of us will be cheering that, especially with the start of the summer travel season. Let's talk about where it's all headed. Julian Ing is Launchtrip's CEO. And I don't think it's a secret millions of people are going to hit the roads, fly, whatever. But what trends do you see for the entire summer travel season? Will we take one vacation or several? JULIAN ING: No, statistically, it's usually about one vacation a year. But due to the pent-up demand for travel over the last year and a half, we're looking at an average of 2, 2.5 trips this year. And I think according to American Express, too, 71% of people will be traveling domestically in the US this coming year. SEANA SMITH: Julian, when you look at where people are going, starting this weekend, we're expected to see this massive surge. People can't wait to get out of their homes and go somewhere. Where are people headed? JULIAN ING: Well, you know what's really funny is, I think with the reopening of a lot of the states, especially your main primary states, like when you're looking at LA, you look at Miami, you look at New York City, you have Orlando, I think a lot of the southern and the more warm states is where a lot of people are heading. And I think one of the biggest trends that I see right now, what we see in the travel industry is that connectivity that people want again. So family trips, reunions, weddings that were put off for all-- for the last year and a half. I think it's just-- it's more than just taking a vacation right now. And I think with the reopening of the United States, I think you'll see a lot of travel trends go that direction. ADAM SHAPIRO: I was a bit aghast at some of the prices for airplane tickets. We were looking at going to a wedding in October. I mean, that's still far out. And the price to get there is outrageous. What are you seeing with airfares?

The airline intends to operate more than 30 daily flights to 16 European destinations this summer.

In Spain, the carrier will resume its five times weekly service connecting New York/Newark with Barcelona in July. In the same month, the airline will also restore its six weekly flights between New York/Newark and Madrid.

Meanwhile, in Italy, the Chicago, IL-based company will start operating daily between New York/Newark and Rome from July onward, when it will also fly daily between New York/Newark and Milan. These flights are part of Italy's COVID-tested flights program and hence customers can avoid quarantine requirements by presenting a negative COVID test result, the company stated.

Apart from the abovementioned flights, United Airlines will add as well as resume several other services to European destinations in response to uptick in air-travel demand for summer. The carrier will begin New York/Newark-Dubrovnik, Croatia service on Jul 1. Additionally, the carrier will resume daily service to Athens, Greece from New York/Newark in June. From Washington D.C., the carrier will launch a new service to Athens in July. In addition to this, the airline will connect Washington D.C. with Frankfurt, Germany.

With growing travel demand for the summer, U.S. airlines have announced intentions to boost schedules. Last month, American Airlines AAL revealed that it would bump up domestic and international schedules for summer owing to “strong demand.” Back then, the airline had stated that it expects summer domestic capacity to be more than 90% of 2019 level and international capacity to be 80% of summer 2019 level. On the domestic front, the carrier plans to widen its connectivity to Orlando, FL, offering customers nonstop services from Birmingham, AL; Dayton, OH; Indianapolis, IN and Louisville, KY, among other places. As for international services, the airline said that it will continue to offer more flights to several destinations in Latin America and the Caribbean.

Previously, Southwest Airlines LUV announced a major service expansion for the summer travel period. Among others, the airline will begin nonstop service to 37 cities from Austin, TX this summer. Some of these destinations include Burbank, CA; Miami, FL; Minneapolis/St. Paul, MN; Orange County, CA and Salt Lake City, UT. These services are set to commence from Jun 6 onward.

Meanwhile, Spirit Airlines SAVE announced plans to launch services in Pensacola, FL this summer.

2021-05-27T10:56:13.000Z,Airline recovery 'not a foregone conclusion': ratings firm CEO,"The summer travel season traditionally takes off over the Memorial Day holiday and U.S. airlines are counting this year on increased passenger loads to help them emerge from the COVID-19 pandemic.  Some 1.8 million passengers passed through security at the nation's airports on May 23, the largest number in more than a year with the average daily number consistently trending higher since mid-March. But ""it is not a foregone conclusion that the market will rebound enough to save all of these businesses,"" RapidRatings CEO James Gellert told Yahoo Finance Live.   His firm runs financial stress tests on major global companies to determine if they can withstand financial shocks created by a crisis like COVID-19. RapidRatings uses a 100 point scale and any score below 40 indicates trouble. Over the last 20 years 90% of companies that have failed have been rated 40 and below on the RapidRatings scale. ""Those ratings started to come down precipitously last year, and you've got the majority of them rated in the 20s and 30s, with the highest being Southwest at a 40,"" Gellert said.   The airlines have taken on billions of dollars in new debt and shored up their balance sheets over the last year, Gellert said. ""They do have enough liquidity to go for the better part of the next 12 to 24 months without a real risk of bankruptcy."" After that, he said all bets are off.   ""They have between 75 and 90% of their assets already secured so it's very hard to borrow more money after all of your assets are effectively pledged. So that's going to give them very little flexibility as we go forward if indeed they need additional capital,"" he cautioned.  The airlines are still losing money but point to shrinking average daily cash burn as a sign they are on the right path. United Airlines (UAL) in a recent SEC 8K filing said, ""yields on tickets issued since the beginning of May 2021 for travel in the second quarter 2021 have reached levels similar to 2019, with domestic leisure yields exceeding 2019 levels for the same time period.""

2021-05-27T09:43:09.000Z,Are U.S. Airlines Set to Make a Comeback in 2021?,"The year 2020 was a challenging one for the U.S. airline industry as the COVID-19 outbreak put travel restrictions in place to curb the spread of the virus. However, the situation has been improving gradually, thanks to the rapid vaccination drive in the country. In fact, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (“CDC”) stated that nearly one in two Americans have received at least one dose of the vaccine while half the citizens above the age of 18 were fully vaccinated as of May 25 morning, as mentioned in a Reuters article. Notably, people are feeling safer to travel now and that has resulted in a bump up in the number of passengers on flights. Interestingly, on May 16, the Transportation Security Administration recorded 1.85 million passengers, as quoted in a Simple Flying article. Moreover, the article stated that this was the first day since the start of the pandemic when over 1.8 million people flew in one day, highlighting the strengthening rebound. Adding to the positive sentiment is also the fact that the CDC has revised its travel guidelines for fully vaccinated people. Markedly, the CDC stated in a report that for traveling, people don’t need to get tested or self-quarantined if they are fully vaccinated or if they have recovered from COVID-19 in the past three months. Meanwhile, the International Air Transport Association (“IATA”) also predicted a rebound this year, at least when it comes to domestic travel. Notably, a report by the IATA stated that domestic markets could recover to 96% of the pre-crisis levels in the second half of 2021, marking an improvement of 48% over 2020. Moreover, IATA expected North American carriers to be best placed to take advantage of the vaccination drive to boost domestic travel in the country. Reflective of these positive developments, U.S. airlines have been ramping up flights to deal with the surging demand for air travel while introducing new travel routes. Notably, American Airlines Group Inc. AAL and JetBlue Airways Corporation JBLU stated that they are adding 24 new routes in eight new cities, as part of their Northeast Alliance partnership, as cited in a New York Post article.

[MUSIC PLAYING] - Interestingly, though, you didn't see JPMorgan's CEO Jamie Dimon there in person. He didn't travel for the shellacking there in front of Congress. But Americans are traveling more and more. Over the weekend, we saw the highest number of travelers at TSA checkpoints since the pandemic, crossing 1.8 million passengers screened Sunday. But of course, that's mostly leisure travel. We've still been waiting for an uptick in business travel to come back. And a lot of airlines might be worried about what the future of travel looks like, particularly in the back half of the year, once we get past the pent-up demand for leisure travel. And joining us now for more on that is our next guest, Mike Boyd, Boyd Group International President. And Mike, thanks for coming on. I mean, when we look at it, obviously, people have been cooped up. People want to get out there. So we're seeing that uptick now, but it doesn't look like airlines are necessarily, across the board, boosting travel demand for later in the year. So what are you watching as, maybe, a potential warning sign there. MIKE BOYD: Well, one of the things we're looking at, for example, United Airlines has cut about 5% out of its schedule in August. They may be seeing something that isn't being-- isn't obvious right now. We think there's going to be a spike, but it's still going to be well below 2019. And next month, they're going to be about 86% of the capacity we had in the same month in 2019, but there's going to be a lot less passengers in that lower load factor. So I think this is going to be the bellwether. We're going to see whether it really is a bubble, people wanting to get to see grandma, which you couldn't do last year, and whether it falls down after Labor Day, which it may do. But as far as business travel goes, it's not coming back to where it was. It was declining before, and this just shoved it down even further.

JULIE HYMAN: Hello, it's time for the next installment in our weeklong series, looking at travel heading into the summer-- travel season leading up to Memorial Day weekend. Adit Damodaran is joining us now. He's an economist at Hopper. And as I was saying in the break, Adit, people better brace themselves perhaps when they're preparing to look at prices, as they're trying to book their summer travel. You guys track prices. Where are we seeing the sort of most acute increases? ADIT DAMODARAN: Yeah, absolutely. So the most acute increases would be in that domestic travel market. Domestic airfares already up 12% since April, and we're expecting it to go up another 4% going into late June. So an average roundtrip in the US domestically would cost about $293 this summer. That's pretty much on par with what we saw in summer 2019. So prices are definitely going up for domestic travel. MYLES UDLAND: You know, Adit, the cost of this stuff always ends up being anecdotal, right? And on my end, it's been the cost of rental cars. Absolute nose bleed prices. Now granted, I am traveling to a somewhat remote airport, let's call it. But rental car prices this summer, I mean, on the floor, what are you guys seeing in your data? ADIT DAMODARAN: Yeah, absolutely. So the demand for rental cars has been astronomical. Demand is up about 500% since January on the Hopper app. And that's in terms of bookings. And rental car prices are following demand also increasing. So rental car prices have doubled since January. They were about $50 a day in January. They're now about $100 a day. And availability seems to be an issue. So if you're going to have to book a rental car, we suggest that that's your priority. BRIAN SOZZI: And Adit, where are people traveling?

2021-05-25T21:00:19.000Z,The airline recovery is looking K-shaped,"As vaccinations increase and the reopening continues, the battered travel industry is getting back in the air. But unsurprisingly, the recovery is once again K-shaped — some sub-sectors are doing much better than others. According to Jefferies senior research analyst Sheila Kahyaoglu, total U.S. airline traffic is around 40% of what it was at the same time in 2019. But the difference between destinations is stark: international is down 67% and domestic is only 22% lower. ""International is still quite weak,"" Kahyaoglu told Yahoo Finance Live. Because of this, domestic airlines like Southwest (LUV) have been seeing much better numbers compared to the larger airlines that fly broader routes out of the country. This appears to be somewhat of consensus right now, due to the discrepancies of the U.S. vaccination campaigns versus the rest of the world that still waits. (Airlines are becoming creative around incentivizing vaccinations.) According to Cowan managing director Helane Becker, the airlines “best positioned” now are Spirit, Allegiant, Frontier, Southwest, and also American, though it has a little more international exposure than the others. “If we’re wrong and international comes back faster than we think, United is the one that benefits the most,” she said. To bet on the international recovery, she added, “you would own United, because they’re 50% domestic, 50% international.” Getting back to 2019 levels may not happen without that international travel, as well as the other key laggard — business travel. “I think it’s going to be difficult for us to get back to 2019 without some international and business traffic coming back,” Becker said. “We don’t think that will happen before 2023.” Still, some people are banking on this. “Investors right now are starting to transition to international, because international hasn’t worked yet,” Kahyaoglu said. Going forward, if Europe is on the table for Americans’ vacation plans, that could change the airline landscape.

2021-05-25T12:52:12.000Z,American Airlines (AAL) to Offer Additional Flights to Spain,"American Airlines Group AAL plans to increase service to Spain, following the country’s recent announcement to allow fully vaccinated travelers into the nation beginning Jun 7.

The airline currently operates daily flights to Barcelona from Miami, FL and to Madrid from Dallas-Fort Worth. Building on this, the carrier will begin two additional flights to Madrid from Miami and New York’s JFK, effective Jun 17. The services will be operating daily. With leisure travel demand continually improving, the new routes are expected to attract substantial traffic during summer. Travelers will be required to provide proof of vaccination upon arrival in Spain.

Last month, American Airlines announced intentions to boost domestic and international schedules for summer owing to “strong demand.” Back then, the airline stated that it expects summer domestic capacity to be more than 90% of 2019 level and international capacity to be 80% of summer 2019 level. On the domestic front, the carrier plans to widen its connectivity to Orlando, FL, offering customers nonstop services from Birmingham, AL; Dayton, OH; Indianapolis, IN and Louisville, KY, among other places. As for international services, the airline said that it will continue to offer more flights to several destinations in Latin America and the Caribbean. American Airlines Group Inc. Price

2021-05-24T15:07:26.000Z,Spirit Airlines is going to jack up prices: analyst,"Helane Becker, Cowen Senior Research Analyst, joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss the rebound in travel demand amid the pandmemic and outlook for airlines over Memorial Day Weekend and throughout the summer. [MUSIC PLAYING] MYLES UDLAND: All right. Well, this weekend marks the unofficial start of summer here in the US, with the Memorial Day holiday. And we're coming off the highest TSA throughput that we have seen since the pandemic began. Joining us now to talk about the outlook for the airline industry in this environment is Helane Becker. She's a senior analyst over at Cowen. Helane, let's start with that data that we got from TSA on throughput. I think it's $1.86 million passengers through checkpoints over the weekend. Where do you-- do you think that we're going to get to 2019 levels before this summer is out, or is some of that international travel just maybe going to keep us below, you know, where we were just before the pandemic? HELANE BECKER: I think it's going to be difficult for us to get back to 2019 without some international and business traffic coming back. So, yes to your question. We think this weekend, from Thursday to Tuesday, we'll see between 10 and 11 million, maybe 12 million people traveling. Most of that is domestic and near international, like the Caribbean, Mexico, Latin America. Europe is starting to open. But a lot of Americans have already made their summer plans. And they're not going to cancel Hawaii or Alaska, or wherever they're going in an effort to go to Europe as it opens because it's opening late. And if you're planning to go away, you probably already made your plans. And that said, I think-- we know Greece is open as is Iceland and Croatia. Italy is open if you're vaccinated and willing to test pre-taking off and pre-- and once you land. And then, of course, you have to test to come back into the US. But that's not a big problem. I think the issue is will France open Portugal. Spain is opening as well. And how many Americans will travel there given that we think a lot of them have already made plans for the summer.

2021-05-20T17:25:05.000Z,Southwest Airlines (LUV) Gives Bullish Cash Burn Update for Q2,"With air-travel demand improving in the United States, particularly for leisure, Southwest Airlines LUV provided a bullish update on average core cash burn for the June quarter. In a SEC filing, management at the Dallas-based carrier said that the average core cash burn, which was $6 million a day in April, is expected in the $1-$3 million band per day for the current quarter. The projection is better than the previous estimate of the metric, which was in the $2-4 million range. Notably, the average core cash burn excludes changes in working capital. The company still expects to achieve a breakeven average core cash flow or better in June 2021. Management further stated that operating revenues, which declined approximately 42% in April 2021 from the April 2019 levels, improved from the March reading owing to better leisure travel demand. As a result of this upbeat scenario, bookings for May and June are on an uptrend. Apart from higher passenger traffic for leisure, uptick in airfares adds to this optimistic scenario. In fact, per management, leisure fare levels in June 2021 are nearing the June 2019 levels, based on current bookings. In another highly encouraging development, the company is currently witnessing improvements, albeit a modest one, in travel demand and bookings for business. Notably, business revenues were down approximately 80% last month from the April 2019 tally. However, the percentage decline compared favorably with the 85% and 90% reductions in March and February (both compared with their respective 2019 levels), respectively. However, management cautioned that despite this progress, business travel demand is still well below the leisure travel trends and is likely to continue hurting close-in demand and average passenger fares in the second quarter of 2021. The carrier expects operating revenues to decline in the 35-40% range during May from the levels witnessed in May 2019. Expecting a further improvement, June operating revenues are anticipated to fall 20-25% from the June 2019 levels.

Boeing last Wednesday sent affected carriers service bulletins on how to address the production issue that could have interfered with some critical systems after the fixes were approved by the Federal Aviation Administration. The action was a relief for American carriers, which have more than 65 of the 109 aircraft affected worldwide and were eager to get planes back into the air before the summer travel season.

Kimberly Goesling, 52, of Fort Worth, initially filed the claim as Jane Doe, as is common in cases where sexual assault victims step forward. She later told the story of what happened to her – and American's role in it – in a Facebook and Instagram video that has reached more than 50,000 people. Click here to watch. Now, in her first interview, Goesling speaks to former Fox News anchor and empowerment advocate Gretchen Carlson for her new internet series called, ""The LIFT UP."" Watch that interview here. ""I am done. I am no longer going to hide from what happened because I'm not the bad guy and I have nothing to hide from,"" Ms. Goesling said. ""If anyone should be hiding, it's American and not me."" Ms. Goesling, a nearly 30-year flight attendant for the airline, has a work record that puts her among the company's best. She was a flight crew leader and worked on the airline's recruitment and training teams. More than once, she received glowing reviews for work performance, often resulting in special assignments. In January 2018, one such trip took her to Germany, where along with other American Airlines employees, she helped develop a special international menu for first- and business-class passengers. Also on the trip was a celebrity chef whom American hired even though the company knew of prior allegations against him for alcohol abuse and inappropriate sexual relationships, according to the lawsuit. On the final night of the group's stay, the chef forced his way into Ms. Goesling's hotel room and sexually assaulted her. American's own investigation later showed he admitted to the attack.

2021-05-18T05:20:44.000Z,An Intrinsic Calculation For American Airlines Group Inc. (NASDAQ:AAL) Suggests It's 43% Undervalued,"How far off is American Airlines Group Inc. (NASDAQ:AAL) from its intrinsic value? Using the most recent financial data, we'll take a look at whether the stock is fairly priced by estimating the company's future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. One way to achieve this is by employing the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. There's really not all that much to it, even though it might appear quite complex. Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you. See our latest analysis for American Airlines Group We are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years. Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate: 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 Levered FCF ($, Millions) -US$2.14b US$380.3m US$2.47b US$3.54b US$3.55b US$3.58b US$3.63b US$3.68b US$3.74b US$3.80b Growth Rate Estimate Source Analyst x6 Analyst x6 Analyst x5 Analyst x2 Analyst x1 Est @ 0.82% Est @ 1.17% Est @ 1.42% Est @ 1.59% Est @ 1.71% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 11% -US$1.9k US$306 US$1.8k US$2.3k US$2.1k US$1.9k US$1.7k US$1.5k US$1.4k US$1.3k (""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)

2021-05-17T23:19:43.000Z,U.S. airlines add COVID-tested flights to Italy as country reopens to tourists,"By Tracy Rucinski CHICAGO, May 17 (Reuters) - United Airlines, Delta Air Lines and American Airlines are adding flights to Italy with protocols for coronavirus testing as the country opens to leisure travelers from the United States for the first time in more than a year. On Sunday, the Italian government eased a number of COVID-19 travel restrictions and requirements as it looks to boost summer tourism, including scrapping a mandatory quarantine for visitors from certain countries as long as they test negative for COVID-19. As a result, United on Monday joined Delta and American in announcing additional COVID-tested flights to the popular European travel spot, which had been closed to tourists from countries including the United States, Canada and Japan. The three U.S. airlines have multiple nonstop options to Rome and Milan and Delta plans to add nonstop flights to Venice from New York in July and from Atlanta in August. U.S. travelers to Italy must take a COVID-19 test no more than 48 hours before boarding and again on arrival. If negative, they will be exempted from quarantine. To return to the United States, travelers must present a negative test taken no more than 72 hours before departure, even if they have been vaccinated. Airlines have lobbied for COVID-tested flights as a path to restart international travel, which has been severely restricted as governments seek to contain coronavirus infections. As cases decline in parts of the world with effective vaccination campaigns, the European Union's executive has recommended easing COVID-19 travel restrictions to let foreign travelers from more countries enter the bloc, which at times has struggled to agree on a common response to the pandemic. The United States continues to ban entry of non-U.S. citizens arriving from most of Europe, despite growing calls from airline industry leaders to speed the reopening of transatlantic travel.

Benzinga covered the three airlines on May 9, and each looks primed for bullish continuation in the week ahead. Traders hoping to catch a larger move in the sector could also watch the U.S. Global Jets ETF (NYSE: JETS). American Airlines, Southwest Airlines, Delta Air Lines Inc (NYSE: DAL) and United Airlines Holdings Inc (NASDAQ: UAL) make up a combined 42% of Jets ETF’s holdings. If there’s continued momentum in individual airlines this week, Jets could offer a way to play it. The Jets Chart: On Friday, Jets’ price attempted to break above resistance at $26.34 but rejected and wicked off it. Jets has attempted to break through this resistance level nine times out of the last 14 trading days. When time a stock or ETF touches a resistance or support zone, the level weakens, making it easier for the price to bust through. Although Jets closed the trading session just under resistance at $26.28, it shot up 3.91% on the day, and printed a bullish green engulfing candle stick, which indicates higher prices could be in the cards for Monday. See also: How to Buy American Airlines (AAL) Stock Also on Friday, Jets was able to regain the eight-day and 21-day exponential moving averages (EMAs) as support, which is bullish. The eight-day EMA is trending below the 21-day EMA, and bulls will want to see the eight-day EMA cross above the 21-day EMA for more confidence. See Also: Carnival And American Airlines Soar As The SPY Closes Higher Bulls want to see Jets break up above its resistance at $26.34 and for continued bullish volume in the ETF. If Jets can break above its overhead resistance, it has room to move up toward $27.44. If it is able to regain that level as support, the ETF is clear to move toward $28.75. Bears want to see Jets continue to reject the overhead resistance and drop back down to its support level at $24.85. If it is unable to hold that level as support, it could revisit $23.71.

""Well, they've been going up fairly dramatically in the last six months at least,"" he told Yahoo Finance. Harrell is president of Harrell Associates, a firm that tracks and benchmarks ticket prices across the industry. In normal times, business fares are four to five times more expensive than leisure fares, according to Harrell, but right now, ""business travel in today's environment is nearly non existent. So the name of the game is leisure fares,"" he said. Harrell's airline index tracks leisure fares across 300 domestic routes in the United States. He said the increase in fares began before Easter and continued through the end of April. ""The leisure fares on a national basis went up by 7.7% which is a lot in a several week period."" That uptick was captured in the April consumer price index (CPI), which showed inflation running up 4.2% driven by increases, ""for shelter, airline fares, recreation, motor vehicle insurance, and household furnishings,"" according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. According to the Transportation Security Administration (TSA), 1.7 million passengers moved through TSA check points on May 9, the largest number in more than a year. In 2019 that number was 2.4 million. Harrell said increased demand is putting pressure on airlines to charge more for tickets as passengers return. ""Airfares will definitely be returning to closer to normal later this year,"" he predicted. ""We believe the Biden administration needs to make a decision about international travel within the next week to 10 days,"" Cowen Equity Research analyst Helane Becker wrote in a note to her clients May 11th.

SEANA SMITH: We want to stick with travel because it's a big story that's trending here at Yahoo Finance. We talk about what the demand looks like ahead of Memorial Day weekend. And for that, we want to bring in Fred Lalonde. He is Hopper's co-founder and CEO. And Fred, I guess, take us through some of the trends that you're seeing right now. What has activity been like on your app over the last several months? FRED LALONDE: Absolutely. Well, demand is definitely back for leisure travel. And it's definitely back in a domestic-- the US domestic market. So the Hopper app tracks almost all of the air shopping and a lot of the hotel demand in real time. This is what we use to do our famous forecasting that our users use. And what we're seeing is that the domestic air travel demand is back to almost 15% lower than pre-pandemic. This is surprising for one reason because business travel is functionally zero right now. So you would estimate that leisure might actually be overpowering a lot of the demand we had before the shutdown last year. Hotel is definitely soaring. A lot of what we're seeing is staycation, so stays that are booked within 200 miles of where people live. And the hottest category right now that we're seeing is car rental. So that is up 500% since the beginning of the year. So everything domestic is definitely up. International travel, as you would imagine, is still very much shut down. We're seeing people that are starting to book for what we call long lead, so maybe that trip to Europe you've been thinking about. But most of what international is right now is Mexico and Caribbean. Actually, one of the most interesting numbers is trips from the US to Mexico and the Caribbean represent 25% of all international travel right now, which is completely abnormal. ADAM SHAPIRO: Hey, Fred, I just got to say, I'm looking forward to the day all those chairs behind you are filled. But until then, as people want to do their staycations, you guys have that new feature, Stay the Night.

2021-05-12T16:45:26.000Z,The US does not have a gas shortage,"The largest gasoline pipeline on the US east coast remained closed on May 12, after a May 8 cyberattack on its owner, Colonial Pipeline. As the closure drags on, concern over a potential regional fuel shortage is mounting. American Airlines added refueling stops to two long-distance flights out of Charlotte, North Carolina, and drivers across the region found a growing number of gas stations out of stock, and rising prices in places that still have supply. In a press conference May 11, US energy secretary Jennifer Granholm said the pipeline is expected to be operational by the weekend, and that Colonial will announce a definitive timeline by the end of May 12. In the meantime, Granholm’s department and the Environmental Protection Agency have issued temporary waivers of federal restrictions on interstate gasoline tanker trucks, which should facilitate the flow of fuel from refineries in the Gulf Coast to gas stations further north. The Department of Homeland Security is also considering waiving the Jones Act, which requires marine vessels moving between US ports to be US-flagged and crewed; that would free up foreign charter tankers to help move fuel. One of the world’s best Covid-19 success stories is inching closer to a lockdown But in the meantime, Granholm warned, drivers across the region are “hoarding” gas. According to GasBuddy, an analytics firm that monitors gas prices and supply, gas demand is 35% higher this week than the previous week in PADD 1, the oil distribution region that covers all of the east coast. Panic-buying poses a greater threat to gas availability than the pipeline closure itself, said Fernando Valle, a senior energy analyst with Bloomberg Intelligence. Gas demand is only just beginning to recover from the pandemic, and distributers had already begun stockpiling gas in advance of the high-demand summer season, so the existing inventory of gas is already fairly high. In other words, the problem for the next few days is distribution, not a real underlying shortage.      ",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/us-does-not-gas-shortage-164526332.html
2021-05-12T12:05:48.000Z,20 Best Airlines in the World in 2021,"In this article, we take a look at the 20 best airlines in the world in 2021. You can skip our detailed analysis of the aviation industry and go to the 5 Best Airlines in the World in 2021. The airline industry was hammered due to the coronavirus crisis, and continues to feel the reverberations of it. International Air Transport Association's analysis shows that up to 4.8 million jobs in aviation might be lost by the beginning of next year, a 43% reduction from pre-COVID levels. Also, IATA research findings show that a loss of over $630 billion was suffered worldwide in GDP benefits from the decline in air travel. Major companies like American Airlines Group Inc. (NASDAQ: AAL), The Boeing Company (NYSE: BA), United Airlines Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: UAL), Southwest Airlines Co. (NYSE: LUV) and Delta Air Lines, Inc. (NYSE: DAL) continue to suffer heavy losses as travelers remain reluctant to fly amid the new variants and outbreaks of the virus. However, the situation is not totally hopeless. Major airliners have already started to see strong signs of recovery. In the U.S., where more than half of the adult population has received its first shot of the COVID-19 vaccine, domestic travel is making a strong comeback. Over the last few weeks, American Airlines Group Inc. (NASDAQ: AAL) planes have been 80% full on average. Southwest Airlines Co. (NYSE: LUV) also saw high traffic in April. Delta Air Lines, Inc. (NYSE: DAL) and United Airlines Holdings Inc. also turned cash-flow positive. As governments scramble to vaccinate their populations in Asia and other parts of the world, international travel is bound to come back to normal. If you are planning for that much-needed vacation and need some help deciding which airline to choose, here is our list of the 20 best airlines in the world in 2021.

2021-05-11T07:59:43.000Z,Gas Stations Run Dry as Pipeline Races to Recover From Hacking,"(Bloomberg) -- Gas stations along the U.S. East Coast are beginning to run out of fuel as North America’s biggest petroleum pipeline races to recover from a paralyzing cyberattack that has kept it shut for days. From Virginia to Florida and Alabama, stations are reporting that they’ve sold out of gasoline as supplies in the region dwindle and panic buying sets in. An estimated 7% of gas stations in Virginia were out of fuel as of late Monday, according to GasBuddy analyst Patrick DeHaan. The White House said in a statement it is monitoring the situation and directing government agencies to help alleviate any shortages. Colonial Pipeline Co. said it’s manually operating a segment of the pipeline running from North Carolina to Maryland and expects to substantially restore all service by the weekend. The Colonial pipeline has been shut down since late Friday. On Monday, the Federal Bureau of Investigation pointed the finger at a ransomware gang known as DarkSide. While President Joe Biden stopped short of blaming the Kremlin for the attack, he said “there is evidence” the hackers or the software they used are “in Russia.” Colonial Chief Executive Officer Joe Blount and a top lieutenant assured Deputy Energy Secretary David Turk and state-level officials that the company has complete operational control of the pipeline and won’t restart shipments until the ransomware has been neutralized. The dwindling supplies come just as the nation’s energy industry was preparing to meet stronger fuel demand from summer travel. Americans are once again commuting to the office and booking flights after a year of restrictions. Depending on the duration of the disruption, retail prices could spike, further stoking fears of inflation as commodity prices rally worldwide. The U.S. East Coast is losing around 1.2 million barrels a day of gasoline supply due to the disruption, according to a note from industry consultant FGE. In Asheville, North Carolina, Aubrey Clements, a clerk at an Exxon Mobil station answered the phone with “Hello, I’m currently out of gas.” The Marathon gas station in Elizabethtown, North Carolina, had roughly two dozen cars waiting to fuel up, said an employee there. Drivers pulling into a station with a sign offering unleaded gasoline for $2.649 per gallon in Manning, South Carolina, were met with pumps covered in yellow and red “out of service” bags.

""We are seeing a really strong rebound in demand in our biggest markets,"" Capuano said on Yahoo Finance Live. ""In March, we saw a stronger demand recovery month-over-month than we have seen in any other month since the pandemic began. And in markets like China, we are seeing demand levels that are actually well above pre-pandemic. And the really exciting thing about that for us, it's not just leisure. In fact in March, we saw business travel in China 5% above where it was in March of 2019."" Capuano's upbeat reads on the business come in the wake of a challenging first quarter as the pandemic continued to weigh on travel demand globally. First quarter worldwide revenue per available room (RevPar) fell 50.3% from a year ago. Worldwide occupancy clocked in at 32.1%, down from 50.3% a year earlier. The first quarter showed the varying pace in the recovery from the pandemic globally.  Marriott's revenue per available room in Greater China surged 80.4% from last as the country led the world into the pandemic and is now coming out of it first. Meanwhile, RevPar in Europe fell 80.4% as the country struggles through its vaccination efforts. Here is how Marriott performed compared to Wall Street estimates for the first quarter: Net Sales: $2.32 billion vs. $2.37 billion Adjusted EBITDA: $296 million vs. $308.7 million Adjusted EPS: $0.10 vs. $0.03 Marriott shares fell 3% in Monday trading as investors digested the mixed quarter, positive comments from management and the company refraining from releasing full-year guidance.

Evidently, Delta Air Lines’ (DAL) March-quarter passenger revenues of $2,748 million bettered the December quarter’s reading by almost 2%. The scenario also looks brighter for the U.S. airlines with summer around the corner. Driven by an enhanced air-travel scenario, many U.S. carriers announced plans to broaden their networks to include their favorite tourist spots.

Finding specific stocks to play bullish or bearish has felt similar to finding a needle in a haystack, especially with tech pulling back from all-time highs over earnings season. The airline sector has yet to take the stage despite a ramp-up in the vaccine rollout and customers returning to the skies for business and travel. Rotation could be set to change this, however. See also: How to Buy Boeing (BA) Stock Boeing Co (NYSE: BA), American Airlines Group Inc (NASDAQ: AAL) and Southwest Airlines (NYSE: LUV) look like they could be set for take-off. The Boeing Chart: On Friday, Boeing broke up from a descending trendline that had been holding it down since April 5. Although Boeing has briefly traded above the trendline, Friday marked the first day the stock has been able to close the day above it. This will give bulls more confidence. On Friday, Boeing also recaptured the eight-day exponential moving average (EMA) and the stock is trading above the 200-day simple moving average (SMA), which are both bullish indicators. Boeing still needs to recapture the 21-day EMA, which it could do this week if bullish volume is sustained. Bulls want to see Boeing’s stock make a move up to its next resistance level at $243.75. Bullish volume could then pop the stock over that level which would then make it support. If Boeing can gain the $243 area as support, it has room to move back up toward the $257.75 mark. Bears want to see Boeing's stock fall back under the descending trendline, which will cause the stock to lose support at $232.70. A loss of that level could see Boeing revisit $223.71 before finding additional support. The American Airlines Chart: On Friday, big bullish volume entered American Airlines and the stock was able to make a 2.37% move north. This helped the stock recapture the eight-day and 21-day EMAs which is bullish.             ",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-airlines-look-bullish-going-164209627.html

""A year ago, I said it would take years — not quarters — to recover, and I will stick to that,"" Fogel said on Yahoo Finance Live. ""It's still going to be years before we are fully recovered."" Fogel says the issue holding back a full travel industry recovery is the international component. Countries remain hesitant to allow foreign tourists while they are working to get cases under control and get their populations vaccinated.  Fogel adds, ""International travel is where we make a lot of money, and it's really very important for the whole industry.""  Booking's first quarter earnings release this week underscored the ongoing pressures on the business from the pandemic. Gross bookings fell for the fifth straight quarter, dropping 3.7% from a year ago. Total sales declined 50.2% year over year. Room nights declined 20.1% from last year.  The company said the U.S. was the strongest performing major country in the first quarter, while Europe remained a drag on the overall business. Those trends appeared to continue into the current quarter.  Domestic room night growth was relatively unchanged in April vs. April 2019, Booking said. Room night growth in Europe declined more than 50% in April.  Booking Holdings shares reflect the cautiousness on the pace of the travel recovery. The stock is up 5.9% year to date, lagging the 12.7% gain for the S&P 500. By and large, Wall Street is sticking with Booking as a potential prime beneficiary of a snapback in travel this year. All of the analysts that rated Booking shares a Buy headed into earnings this week have left their ratings intact following the report, according to Bloomberg data.  ""While uncertainty around the shape and timing of the recovery remains a key risk, we continue to like Booking as a value recovery play. At 18.7 times consensus '22 EBITDA [earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization], Booking trades slightly above its five-year average of 15.9 times but the stock looks cheap relative to broader tech,"" wrote Jefferies analyst Brent Thill in a research note.

The number of U.S. air travelers is still about 35% lower than the same date in 2019, down nearly 1 million travelers, TSA said. U.S. airlines have been adding more flights, anticipating rising summer travel demand. U.S. airline stocks rose Friday on optimism about travel demand, with United Airlines up 2.3%, American Airlines up 2% and Delta Air Lines up 2.3%. This is the second new post March 2020 high set this week. TSA said it had screened nearly 1.63 million passengers on Sunday at U.S. airports. Thursday's figure was up about 17,000 over Sunday. By comparison, just 190,000 people were screened at U.S. airports on the same day in May 2020. U.S. airlines have been adding more flights, anticipating rising summer travel demand. Last month, United Airlines said it was adding more than 480 daily flights to its U.S. schedule in June to meet summer travel demand that is expected to rise as more people receive COVID-19 vaccines. American Airlines said in April it expects to fly more than 90% of its domestic seat capacity compared with summer 2019 and 80% of its international seat capacity compared with 2019, and it will operate more than 150 new routes this summer. Airlines are seeing an uptick in bookings as accelerated vaccination efforts encourage leisure travel with friends and family after months of pandemic-linked restrictions.

Results were hurt by the huge plummet in passenger revenues. Also, air-travel remained weak on a year-over-year basis. Further, heavyweights like American Airlines AAL and Southwest Airlines LUV reported first-quarter loss due to dwindling passenger revenues as mentioned in the previous week’s write up. Additionally, SkyWest SKYW underperformed estimates in the March quarter despite reporting earnings, unlike the above two carriers. SkyWest’s results were affected by a significant cut in the number of scheduled flights as a result of the pandemic. 1. SkyWest, currently carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), reported first-quarter 2021 earnings of 71 cents per share, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 89 cents. The bottom line, however, jumped 20.3% year over year owing to significant reduction in operating expenses. Meanwhile, quarterly revenues of $534.6 million fell shy of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $539 million. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here. 2. Allegiant incurred first-quarter 2021 loss (excluding $4 from non-recurring items) of $3.58 per share, wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of $3.17. Results were hurt by coronavirus-induced weakness in air-travel demand. However, sentiments were bullish in the year-ago quarter when the company delivered earnings of $2.05 per share. Moreover, operating revenues of $279.1 million plunged 31.8% year over year and also missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $284.3 million. This downside was due to 32.3% fall in passenger revenues. However, owing to improving air-travel demand in the United States, the carrier expects capacity (measured in available seat miles or ASMs) in second-quarter 2021 to expand from the number reported in second-quarter 2019. For the second quarter, ASM (for scheduled service as well as total system) is expected to increase between 2% and 6% from the second-quarter 2019 reported figures.

A passenger on a Southwest Airlines flight about to take off from Chicago to Sacramento also refused to wear a mask, called two flight attendants who ordered him off the plane ""pathetic"" and hit one of the crew members with his luggage as he walked off, the agency said. And then there is the flier on an Alaska Airlines plane preparing to fly from Bozeman, Mont., to Seattle who ignored repeated reminders to wear a mask, causing the plane to return to the gate, according to the FAA. The incidents of passengers being unruly — ignoring crew members' instructions, fighting and refusing to wear a mask — have been surging, according to the FAA, even while the number of Americans flying on commercial planes remains about 40% below pre-pandemic levels. The rise comes despite a new federal law that makes wearing a mask on commercial flights mandatory, punishable by a fine of $250 for the first offense and up to $1,500 for repeat offenses. Before it became law, the nation's airlines adopted mask-wearing policies, enforcing them by banning repeat offenders from flying. The federal mask mandate, which began Feb. 1, was set to expire May 11. But the U.S. Transportation Security Administration recently extended it through Sept. 13. ""The physical and verbal abuse that flight attendants have been taking has been way off the charts,” Sara Nelson, president of the Assn. of Flight Attendants-CWA, AFL-CIO, told NBC News.

American Airlines Group Inc, based in Forth Worth, Texas, Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co, Microsoft Corp , Salesforce.com Inc and Unilever Plc are among more than 50 companies, chambers of commerce and business leaders in one of the coalitions, Fair Elections Texas. ""When more people participate in our democratic process, we will all prosper,"" said the letter they released. Texas state lawmakers are considering two bills, one from the House and one from the Senate, that would limit early voting, change polling locations, restrict how voters can apply for mail-in ballots and give partisan poll watchers more power. The House is expected to hold a floor vote on its bill soon, after which lawmakers would try to reconcile the differences between the House and Senate bills in a separate committee. The proposals are the latest among voting limitations also introduced by Republicans in Georgia, Arizona and Florida, citing unsubstantiated claims by former President Donald Trump that the November election he lost to Democrat Joe Biden was stolen from him. Top U.S. companies decried Georgia's law, and Major League Baseball moved its All-Star game out of the state in protest. The second letter to Texas lawmakers on Tuesday came from a group of about 175 Houston-area business and community leaders. It said that the bills under consideration would ""damage our competitiveness in attracting businesses and workers to Houston."" The office of the state's Speaker of the House, Republican Dade Phelan, did not immediately return a call for comment. After American Airlines first criticized one of the proposed bills in April, Texas Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick accused American’s chief executive of failing to read it, something the airline denied.

Mann & Company, joins Yahoo Finance’s Alexis Christoforous to discuss outlook on the travel industry amid the pandemic. [MUSIC PLAYING] ALEXIS CHRISTOFOROUS: Welcome back. Warren Buffett said he doesn't regret selling airline stocks last year when the pandemic-induced lockdowns grounded air travel. And he told shareholders at the annual meeting this weekend that he wouldn't invest in airlines now given the current pressure they're under. WARREN BUFFETT: The airlines, clearly what happened was not their fault in any way, shape, or form. It wasn't like 2008-2009 when people blamed the banks and hated to see them helped. I think the airline business has done better because we've sold, and I wish them well. But I still wouldn't want to buy the airline business. ALEXIS CHRISTOFOROUS: Well we know that after he sold Delta and Southwest, those stocks went on to rally more than 45% from the end of May last year through now. Joining us now to talk about the outlook for the airline industry is analyst Robert Manne of RW Mann and Company and a former airline executive himself. Robert, thanks so much for being with us. What do you make of Buffett steering clear of airline stocks right now? Is he passing up what could be a very good opportunity do you think? ROBERT MANN: Well he already has, to some extent. He took his losses, didn't buy back in, and has not ridden the semi-return. There's more to come. But I would say as a timing expert, perhaps this was not his greatest call, all respect to his other calls, of course. ALEXIS CHRISTOFOROUS: And within the airline sector right now, who do you think is best poised to bounce back? We're seeing that the airlines in general are coming under some pressure today, but is there more runway here? And who within that group do you like? ROBERT MANN: Sure. Well the airlines that are best positioned are those who formerly dealt in domestic leisure market activity, where the demand is now strongest and where the fare levels are commensurate with their cost structures. So it's the Spirits, it's the JetBlue's, it's the Southwests, it's the Frontiers.        ",https://finance.yahoo.com/video/airlines-best-positioned-bounce-back-183710781.html

The brightening scenario is reflected in the price movement of airline heavyweights during the three-month period (January-March), which is included in the first-quarter results. Notably, shares of Delta Air Lines DAL, United Airlines UAL, American Airlines AAL, Southwest Airlines LUV and Alaska Air Group ALK gained 20%,33%, 51.5%, 31% and 33.1%, respectively, in the above period, well above the S& P 500’s 6.3% appreciation in the same time frame. Even though U.S. airlines incurred losses in the first quarter of 2021, echoing the dismal four-quarter show of 2020, in most cases, the metric compared favorably with either the sequential quarter or the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review. For example, American Airlines’ first-quarter loss (on an adjusted basis) of $4.32 per share was narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of $4.35. Similarly, Alaska Air’s loss (excluding $2.46 from non-recurring items) of $3.51 per share was narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of $3.71. Southwest Airlines also incurred a narrower-than-expected loss per share in the March quarter. Additionally, JetBlue Airways’ JBLU first-quarter 2021 loss (excluding 70 cents from non-recurring items) of $1.48 per share compared favorably with the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of $1.62. Moreover, JetBlue’s loss per share was narrower than the loss of $1.53 incurred in fourth-quarter 2020. Notably, Southwest Airlines, American Airlines, Alaska Air and JetBlue currently carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.

2021-05-01T20:14:45.000Z,Warren Buffett dumped airline stocks to save them from a disaster,"Warren Buffett took massive losses on Berkshire Hathaway's holdings in U.S. airlines early in the COVID-19 pandemic so that Delta Airlines (DAL), United Airlines (UAL), American Airlines (AAL) and Southwest Airlines (LUV) could benefit from government aid without the cloud of a billionaire investor such as Buffett himself benefitting from behind the scenes. Berkshire CEO Buffett famously loaded up on the stock of the four biggest U.S. airline carriers in 2016 — and then unceremoniously announced in May 2020 that he'd closed out the positions at significant losses. (The airline stocks would all eventually trough on May 25.) But it wasn't until the 2021 Berkshire Hathaway Annual Shareholders meeting that investors discovered the reason. ""[The airlines] might very well have had a very, very, very different result if they had had a very, very, very, rich shareholder that owned 8% or 9%. They didn't have that. You might not have gotten the same result. In fact, you probably wouldn't. I can see the headlines because you've seen the headlines on some companies that took $100 million. The airline didn't need it. Some of them gave it back. Most of them gave it back. But you're actually looking at a different result than if we had kept our stock,"" said Buffett at the event which is being exclusively live-streamed by Yahoo Finance. Buffett explained that Berkshire only approached the decision-making process after it was assured through the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act that there would be a robust backstop in the markets — until both monetary and fiscal policy kicked in.  ""[W]e had an incredible problem. Just as Charlie is the chief culture officer, I'm chief rick officer at Berkshire. That's my job. We hope we do well, but we want to be sure we don't do terribly ... We had a few people ... that wanted to go in for help from the government. They said, 'Everybody's going in for them. Why don't we go in?' I said, 'Berkshire can handle it. This is for people that can't handle it, so we're not applying for it'"" Buffett said.

DAL kick started the first-quarter earnings season for the airline space. Overall, the season has been mixed for the industry. The sector still has to traverse a long way before it can reach the pre-pandemic level. However, the pureplay airlines ETF U.S. Global Jets ETF JETS was up 3.1% past week, down 1.3% in the past month and up 21.1% in the past three-month period. In fact, the fund beat the S&P 500 (up 8.6%) in the past three-month period. This makes JETS a great bet for vaccine rollout and economic optimism. Still, we need to pay attention to the earnings picture of the industry. Let’s delve a little deeper. Delta Air Lines DAL first-quarter 2021 loss (excluding $1.70 from non-recurring items) of $3.55 per share was wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.08 as well as the first-quarter 2020 loss of 51 cents. This was the fifth successive quarterly loss incurred by this Atlanta-GA based company. Due to the passenger revenue weakness, total revenues in the March quarter tanked 51.7% and 60% to $4.150 billion from the first-quarter 2020 and 2019 levels, respectively. Revenues, however, topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.82 billion. Fuel price per gallon is anticipated in the $1.85-$1.95 range in Q2. The non-fuel unit cost (adjusted) is expected to increase between 6% and 9%. United Airlines UAL came out with a quarterly loss of $7.50 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of $6.97. This compared to loss of $2.57 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items. United posted revenues of $3.22 billion for the quarter ended March 2021, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.99%. American Airlines Group Inc.’s AAL incurred a loss (excluding $2.35 from non-recurring items) of $4.32 per share, comparing favorably with the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of $4.35. However, quarterly loss per share was wider than the year-ago loss of $2.65.

2021-04-27T13:48:49.000Z,How Warren Buffett's airline stocks have performed since Berkshire Hathaway sold them,"Warren Buffett has a storied history with airline stocks, once quipping, ""I am Warren and I am an aeroholic."" But the spectacular returns for the industry over the last year are casting a dark cloud on Berkshire Hathaway's decision to dump all of its airline holdings in May 2020 as prices were bottoming. Berkshire loaded up on stock of the four major U.S. carriers in 2016. At the 2020 Berkshire annual shareholders meeting, Buffett said he'd spent $7 billion to $8 billion amassing stakes in Delta Air Lines, United Airlines, American Airlines and Southwest Airlines. He didn't comment on the exit prices except to say, ""We did not take out anything like $7 [billion] or $8 billion."" This contributed to Berkshire's massive $50 billion loss in the first quarter of 2020.  Since then the stocks have taken off, with American and Southwest up over 80% since their May 25, 2020 bottom, while United and Delta are up about 70%. Measuring gains from the May 25, 2020 trough of all four airlines produces even more spectacular results. United was up over 200% over the period, while American was up 190%. The worst losses over the period, which aren't necessarily reflective of Berkshire losses in the positions, were palpable. United was down over 70% at the nadir, and both Delta and American had sunk over 60%. An investment that loses 70% requires a 333% gain to get back to breakeven. Buffett's first investment foray into airlines began with USAir preferred stock in 1989. While Berkshire made money on the dividends, Buffett himself would lament the decision for decades, casting aspersions on the low-profit, expensive nature of the industry. In the same interview where Buffett self-identified as an ""aeroholic,"" he said, ""If a capitalist had been present at Kitty Hawk back in the early 1900s, he should have shot Orville Wright. He would have saved his progeny money. But seriously, the airline business has been extraordinary. It has eaten up capital over the past century like almost no other business because people seem to keep coming back to it and putting fresh money in. You've got huge fixed costs, you've got strong labor unions and you've got commodity pricing. That is not a great recipe for success.""

2021-04-26T19:25:54.000Z,Here's what Buffett should have done with Berkshire's airline stocks: Bill Smead,"Smead Capital Management Chief Investment Officer Bill Smead sat down with Yahoo Finance's Jared Blikre to discuss investing in a historic market after the coronavirus pandemic for this special Yahoo Finance Plus webinar. BILL SMEAD: We don't have to use 2020 hindsight. I wrote about what he said that day in a fairly extensive missive that your folks can go back and take a look at at SmeadCat.com. And Charlie and Warren say that successful investing is an unusual combination of patience and aggression. And this is not a criticism of Warren Buffett, because he has been the most brilliant investor of my lifetime and has been a resource and teacher like none other that we can all be very thankful for and grateful for-- but that clip just reminds me that at 90, Warren has lost some of his aggression. And airline stocks are not the kind of stocks that you want to deal with if you've lost some of your aggression, because that business is tough. It's capital-intensive. It's labor-intensive. There are all kinds of things that they don't control that affect their business all the time. And again, the answer to your question is, the airline business will be attractive and has a better moat than it used to, which is what attracted Warren to get back involved in them. But then he got reminded that he should belong to Airlines Anonymous. And by the way, all of us have investors in industries or sectors that we should probably never get involved in.

ALEXIS CHRISTOFOROUS: You could say we've reached a milestone in this pandemic. Americans who have been fully vaccinated will apparently be allowed to travel to Europe beginning this summer. Here to talk about it is the Points Guy himself, Brian Kelly. Brian, good to see you. I don't know how much information you have on this. I know the president of the European Commission has not exactly given us a timeline quite yet. But how do you think that these countries are going to be able to know for sure that we've been vaccinated? I know they've been talking a long time about the possibility of a vaccine passport. What are you hearing? BRIAN KELLY: Yeah, it's a great point. You know, the president of the EU shocked a lot of us in the industry yesterday by saying that the entire block will be open this summer. However, as we all know in the US, all we have are vaccination cards. They are not the World Health Organization cards. And President Biden has said there will not be a national database of those who are vaccinated. So it's going to take some collaboration with third parties. I know IATA has a travel passport app. But will we ever be able to 100% confirm someone has the vaccine from the US? The answer is, no. SIBILE MARCELLUS: Well, are they going to go off of our word of honor? You know, when you buy a ticket, you say, well, I'm fully vaccinated, then Europe has to let you in. I mean, how is Europe handling traveling within their own bloc with countries there? BRIAN KELLY: Yeah, you know, it's going to be up to the discretion of the border agent. Hopefully they have an app where you can get preclearance in advance. Because if they don't have that sort of assurance that you're actually going to be able to get let in, they're not going to see the levels of tourists that they're hoping-- that they, frankly, need.

American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) stock was up 2% while Delta (NYSE:DAL), United (NASDAQ:UAL) and JetBlue (NASDAQ:JBLU) were all up just over 1%. Airline system sales fell 64.1% for the week ending April 18, compared with the level seen for the same week in 2019 when the world hadn’t heard of Covid-19, according to research from Bank of America (NYSE:BAC). That marks a sequential improvement from the -66.3% and -69.8% levels of the prior two weeks. The bank added domestic leisure is maintaining its strong run with tickets sold for this segment through online agencies down only 0.4% against the 2019 level. In expectation of traffic improving further, with customers stuffed full of cash given the hefty levels of fiscal stimulus, airlines like American, Jet, United have also been adding capacities on both domestic and international routes with plans for more. Adding to the growing air of confidence surrounding the battered travel sector, Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, told The New York Times Sunday that the European Union would likely allow fully vaccinated U.S. tourists to visit the region this summer, potentially helping the European tourist economy recover during its crucial summer season.

2021-04-22T19:13:42.000Z,Why Southwest CEO Gary Kelly is 'euphoric' about airline recovery,"Southwest Airlines (LUV) released earnings that beat expectations on Thursday morning, and CEO Gary Kelly told Yahoo Finance Live that his mood is ""euphoric"" as passengers return to the skies.  The airline boosted flight activity by 50% on March 11 and added 1,000 daily departures, Kelly pointed out to Yahoo Finance. Operating revenue, $2.1 billion, was down year over year 51% and down 60% compared to 2019 but still beat analysts' expectations, according to the first-quarter earnings results.  While Southwest posted a $116 million profit, the airline would have had a $1 billion loss for the quarter if it had not received aid from the federal government. Still, booking trends have improved, and Southwest projects operating revenue in May will be down 35% to 40%. ""We can actually forecast June to the point where we think it could be break-even or even positive cash flow,"" Kelly said. ""Gives us a lot of confidence that the worst is behind us."" Southwest ended the quarter with $15.3 billion in liquidity and an increase in ASMs (available seat miles) or capacity, which will allow it to accommodate pandemic fatigued Americans who are ready to travel. ""We believe there is significant pent-up demand for leisure travel and are optimistic about summer 2021,"" the airline told investors in its Q1 earnings report. The improving trends explain why Southwest is flying high heading into the summer travel season. But Kelly cautioned a similar trend last year stalled when the pandemic intensified.  ""You know we had a faint last year in June, July where things were improving and we were extrapolating those trends into the fall and boosted our flight activity and it turned out to be premature,"" he said. But this time, Kelly says vaccines that prevent serious COVID-19 illness, which started becoming available in January, are making a big difference. ""And so finally, January, February with the vaccines rolling out we began to see a change,"" Kelly added.

2021-04-22T16:27:22.000Z,WRAPUP 1-Vaccines put U.S. airlines on runway to recovery,"(Updates shares, adds pilot hiring plans and Alaska Air results) By Sanjana Shivdas and Ankit Ajmera April 22 (Reuters) - U.S. carriers American Airlines and Southwest Airlines on Thursday signaled slower cash burn and pointed to a rebound in summer bookings as accelerated COVID-19 vaccinations make more people confident about traveling again. After nearly a year in the doldrums due to the pandemic, airlines are seeing light at the end of the tunnel with over 50% of the U.S. population having received one dose of the vaccine. ""March was clearly a significant improvement over January and February and guidance is for continued improvement into the June quarter and the summer beyond it,"" Cowen and Co analyst Helane Becker said. Southwest forecast second-quarter average daily core cash burn between $2 million and $4 million, compared with about $13 million per day in the prior quarter. American said average daily cash burn slowed to $4 million in March, while its overall average daily cash burn rate was about $27 million in the first quarter. Southwest said it expects second-quarter capacity to rise about 90% from a year earlier, while American sees capacity to be down between 20% and 25% compared with 2019, slowing from a 35% fall in the previous quarter. Southwest shares rose 1.7%, while American Airlines stock was marginally down. American has a bigger exposure to international travel, which is not expected to rebound soon as most borders remained closed, analysts have said. ""I know (the Biden administration) understands the importance of restoring international travel to the economy,"" American Airlines CEO Doug Parker said. ""We all need to go look at this in a risk-based way. No one wants to rush for certain, and no one's pushing that either."" Southwest is recalling some furloughed pilots and flight attendants, while American plans to do it later this year to prepare for 2022.

2021-04-22T15:40:03.000Z,American Airlines' (AAL) Q1 Loss Narrower Than Expected,"American Airlines’ AAL first-quarter 2021 loss puts it in the same boat of Alaska Air Group ALK, United Airlines UAL and Delta Air Lines DAL as all suffered a similar setback. The airline incurred a loss (excluding $2.35 from non-recurring items) of $4.32 per share, comparing favorably with the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of $4.35. However, quarterly loss per share was wider than the year-ago loss of $2.65. Moreover, operating revenues of $4,008 million slumped 52.9% year over year and also fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4,031 million. Passenger revenues, which accounted for bulk of the top line (79.3%), plunged 58.6% to $3,179 million. Cargo revenues surged in excess of 100% to $315 million, driven by the carrier’s focus on its cargo unit in the face of dwindling passenger revenues. Cargo yield per ton mile jumped 76% in the first quarter of 2021. Other revenues dropped 25.3%. Total revenue per available seat mile (TRASM: a key measure of unit revenues) decreased 22.6% year over year to 10.61 cents in the reported quarter on a consolidated basis. Further, passenger revenue per available seat miles (PRASM) fell 31.9% to 8.42 cents in the period. Moreover, consolidated yield was down 16.8%. While consolidated traffic (measured in revenue passenger miles) plummeted 50.3%, capacity (measured in average seat miles) contracted 39.2%. Consolidated load factor (percentage of seats filled by passengers) decreased 13.2 percentage points to 59.5% as traffic decline was more than the capacity reduction. Total operating costs (on a reported basis) declined 51.9% year over year to $5,323 million with expenses pertaining to aircraft fuel and related taxes tumbling 42%. However, consolidated operating costs per available seat mile (CASM: excluding fuel and special items) shot up 21.1% to 19.19 cents due to weak capacity. With a portion of the fleet remaining grounded/under-utilized, fuel gallons consumed tanked 37.2%. Average fuel price per gallon (including related taxes) also fell 7.4% to $1.70.

2021-04-22T14:43:28.000Z,Vaccines put U.S. airlines on runway to recovery,"By Sanjana Shivdas and Ankit Ajmera (Reuters) - U.S. carriers American Airlines and Southwest Airlines on Thursday signaled slower cash burn and pointed to a rebound in summer bookings as accelerated COVID-19 vaccinations make more people confident about traveling again. After nearly a year in the doldrums due to the pandemic, airlines are seeing light at the end of the tunnel with over 50% of the U.S. population having received one dose of the vaccine. ""March was clearly a significant improvement over January and February and guidance is for continued improvement into the June quarter and the summer beyond it,"" Cowen and Co analyst Helane Becker said. Southwest forecast second-quarter average daily core cash burn between $2 million and $4 million, compared with about $13 million per day in the prior quarter. American said average daily cash burn slowed to $4 million in March, while its overall average daily cash burn rate was about $27 million in the first quarter. Southwest said it expects second-quarter capacity to rise about 90% from a year earlier, while American sees capacity to be down between 20% and 25% compared with 2019, slowing from a 35% fall in the previous quarter. Southwest shares rose 1.7%, while American Airlines stock was marginally down. American has a bigger exposure to international travel, which is not expected to rebound soon as most borders remained closed, analysts have said. ""I know (the Biden administration) understands the importance of restoring international travel to the economy,"" American Airlines CEO Doug Parker said. ""We all need to go look at this in a risk-based way. No one wants to rush for certain, and no one's pushing that either."" Southwest is recalling some furloughed pilots and flight attendants, while American plans to do it later this year to prepare for 2022. Meanwhile, operating revenue at the companies fell more than 50%, slower than the about 65% fall in the fourth quarter.

2021-04-22T14:39:02.000Z,Weekly Jobless Claims Came in Lower-than-Expected,"Ahead of today’s opening bell, we see a new low for Initial Jobless Claims in the pandemic era: 547K new claims were made last week, below the 603K analysts were expecting and notably below the upwardly revised 586K from the previous week. A year ago, we were still seeing almost 3 million more new jobless claims than we do now. Obviously, we’re not yet close to pre-pandemic levels, but if we continue at this pace, we’ll shed another 1/3 of our totals over the next 12 weeks.

Continuing Claims of 3.67 million also made a new low since the pandemic began to squeeze the labor force, down from the downwardly revised 3.71 million the previous week. These longer-term claims are reported a week previous to initial claims, so indications are for this trend to keep sloping lower. We also continue to absorb very long-term and other forms of pandemic-induced unemployment via Pandemic Unemployment Assistance (PUA), which is being kept in place for now.

AT&T T posted a better quarter than expected in its Q1 earnings release before today’s opening bell, with 86 cents per share reported for the quarter a 9-cent beat over the Zacks consensus, 2 cents higher than Q1 2020. Revenues also came in hotter than projections indicated: $43.94 billion from $42.76 billion consensus. With stronger competition than ever before in telecom services and streaming entertainment, this strong Q1 report is sending T shares up 4%, swinging to positive for the year.

Southwest Airlines LUV beat expectations by a solid dime to a quarterly loss of $1.72 per share. Revenues also topped the Zacks consensus slightly, to $2.05 billion in the quarter from $2.03 billion estimated. The company is “hopeful” it can bring to an end its cash burn by June, the end of the current quarter. With travel plans picking up, we expect major airlines to climb out of their pandemic holes.

2021-04-22T14:25:27.000Z,"American, Southwest, Alaska Report Today With Focus On Summer Travel Demand","It’s a busy day for the airlines as three major carriers report and investors wait to hear what they might say about summer travel trends. In the meantime, broader market action looks a little unsettled to start the day without much direction one way or another. It might be a bit of a wait-and-see kind of day, but the news is starting to trickle in and a lot of it looks positive. First of all, initial jobless claims fell to 547,000 last week, down from a revised 586,000 the week before. It’s a new post-Covid low for this metric, but still about double what we saw before the pandemic. You never want to make too much of one number, but you continue to see the trend move in the right direction and that’s what you want. If you read this column yesterday, you might remember we suggested that Wednesday could be a test of market sentiment after a two-day pullback. If yesterday was actually a test, it passed with flying colors, with the major indices solidly in the green. The Russell 2000 (RUT) small-cap index, which had been under more pressure earlier this week than its fellow indices, actually had a great day and rose more than 2%. While yesterday’s weather was sunny on Wall Street, keep in mind that it followed two days of rain, so basically we’re back to where we started the week. Stocks did see some buying in the final hour yesterday, which can sometimes indicate a chance for follow-through. However, the overnight session featured a bit of weakness, so it’s unclear if spillover buying is in store. Checking overseas, the European Central Bank (ECB) kept rates and bond-buying unchanged Thursday. Neither is really a big surprise, so it’s probably not a market-moving event. Earnings continue to drive the day, and so far they’ve been pretty good. Basically, if you beat consensus on revenue, you’re fine, but if a company misses on revenue, they’re getting hammered. People also want to see companies paint a better picture of the future.                             ",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/american-southwest-alaska-report-today-142527341.html

MYLES UDLAND: --at what we're seeing over in some of those stocks in the premarket, the stocks of all those that we mentioned in the open, Southwest, Alaska, and American, up about 3% in premarket here, following their latest quarterly reports. And let's just start, guys, with the story at American and the story at Southwest, which is similar in that better than expected performance on the top and the bottom lines, smaller than expected quarterly loss, and both companies pointing towards a point at which they would be breakeven on a cash flow basis. Both companies still losing money. American is now excited about a $27 million per day cash burn. Southwest, obviously, is a much smaller airline, talking about a $2 million to $4 million per day cash burn. But both companies here, guys, really talking, as I think we can sort of feel all around us, the reopening trade and likely a buoyant summer, at least for domestic travel. Better news, obviously, for Southwest specifically than American. But Julie, there's certainly-- certainly, the airlines, I think, all else equal, we sat them down this time last year, they would be quite pleased to be seeing the trajectory that these businesses have been on over the last quarter. JULIE HYMAN: Yeah. And to your point, it does seem like the domestically focused smaller airlines are going to be better positioned here. Alaska also reported this morning. And there too we saw some similar trends in terms of a narrower loss than expected, revenue better than expected, load factor better than expected. And their cash flow actually already turned positive in March. So you're talking about a smaller airline there as well, and obviously domestically focused. So that seems to be more of an advantage in this point in time. When you talk about getting back to where we were, I mean, the milestone at Southwest that it's pointing to is that by summer, the number of its flights will be almost at the level of 2019. So you know, you wrote about it in this Morning Brief this morning, talking that companies are sort of taking last year out of the equation, in some cases, in terms of their commentary and now comparing things to 2019. So that would definitely be sort of the benchmark for the airlines, if they can get back to those levels.     ",https://finance.yahoo.com/video/southwest-earnings-beat-revenue-miss-132437994.html
2021-04-22T12:15:12.000Z,"American Airlines (AAL) Reports Q1 Loss, Lags Revenue Estimates","American Airlines (AAL) came out with a quarterly loss of $4.32 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of $4.35. This compares to loss of $2.65 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items. This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 0.69%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this world's largest airline would post a loss of $3.92 per share when it actually produced a loss of $3.86, delivering a surprise of 1.53%. Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. American Airlines, which belongs to the Zacks Transportation - Airline industry, posted revenues of $4.01 billion for the quarter ended March 2021, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.57%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $8.52 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters. The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call. American Airlines shares have added about 29.2% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 10.1%. What's Next for American Airlines? While American Airlines has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock? There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately. Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.

Airlines are racing to add flights to Tel Aviv as groups of foreign tourists who have been vaccinated against COVID-19 will be allowed into Israel from May 23. ""As we look to the world reopening and travel resuming, the Italies and Frances are a little behind Israel in terms of when we anticipate travel will reopen. And that's due to vaccines,"" said Brian Znotins, vice president of network and schedule planning at American Airlines, referring to two other tourist destinations. Israel, which has vaccinated more than half its population, sees its main challenge as ensuring its reopening does not allow another increase in COVID-19 infections. ""We do not want to risk any of the variants that might come into Israel and jeopardize normalcy,"" Tourism Minister Orit Farkash-Hacohen told Reuters. But, describing Israel as the first country to exit the pandemic, she said it ""should harness this advantage to our economic and tourism benefit."" The concerns about preventing another rise in infections mean Israel is initially opening only to small groups of tourists. It could take at least until July for all tourists to be able to come. Other problems facing the global tourism sector include convincing people it is safe to travel and quarantine requirements in many countries for people returning from abroad. Israel will also face competition from other countries planning to open, such as Greece. With the biggest percentage of tourists to Israel coming from the United States, American Airlines is launching flights from New York in early May and from Miami a month later, using Boeing 777 aircraft grounded during the pandemic.

2021-04-22T08:38:39.000Z,"American, Southwest Gain As Leisure Travel Returns, Hope For Better Times","By Dhirendra Tripathi Investing.com – American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) and Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) were both up in Thursday’s premarket following earnings updates that indicate better times for their sector as people look to get out and travel after a year of being locked in. American Airlines reported its net loss fell to $1.3 billion in the March quarter from $2.2 billion in October-December. This was even as revenue remained unchanged at $4 billion. The company’s total available cash of $17.3 billion at the end of the quarter was higher than its forecast of $15 billion liquidity and it said this could hit $19.5 billion by end of June, as cash flow improves with rising passenger numbers. Southwest’s performance was even better as the airline managed to generate net income of $116 million for the quarter through March, after a net loss of $908 million for October-December. For Southwest, total operating revenues rose by $100 million to $2.1 billion. It said it is in the process of adding flights in June, expects June available capacity to be only slightly less than June 2019 pre-pandemic levels. While leisure travel bounces back, Southwest did warn “business travel is expected to have a significant negative impact on close-in demand and average passenger fares”. That didn’t deter Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) analyst Sheila Kahyaoglu from maintaining a ‘buy’ on Southwest. She has a target of $75 for the stock, representing upside potential of some 21% from its present price of $62.

2021-04-21T17:46:05.000Z,"Airline Stock Q1 Earnings Roster for Apr 22: LUV, AAL & More","After being rattled by the coronavirus-led demand depression for air travel, things are looking up for the U.S. airlines this year. With more and more Americans getting vaccinated each day, air-travel demand is improving particularly on the leisure front. Despite this recent uptick, air-travel demand is still way below the pre-pandemic levels. As a result, both Delta Air Lines DAL and United Airlines UAL reported losses for the March quarter, primarily due to passenger revenue weakness. With most aviation stocks yet to report earnings, we fear that their stories are unlikely to be any different from the results of Delta and United Airlines. Moreover, the increase in fuel price per gallon (up 22% in the January-March period) is likely to hurt the bottom lines of most participants. Given the above-mentioned factors, investors interested in the airline space will await the first-quarter 2021 earnings releases of Southwest Airlines LUV, American Airlines AAL, Alaska Air Group ALK and Controladora Vuela Compañía de Aviación, S.A.B. de C.V. or Volaris VLRS. These four carriers are scheduled to report March-quarter results on Apr 22. Let’s see how things have been shaping up for these prominent airline companies ahead of their earnings releases. Our quantitative model predicts an earnings beat for the company with a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) as this combination increases the chances of an earnings beat. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here. We expect Dallas-based Southwest Airlines’ first-quarter performance to have been aided by the uptick in passenger revenues amid the recent improvement in air-travel demand. Evidently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter passenger revenues indicates a 1.5% increase from the fourth-quarter 2020 reported figure. However, in light of the year-over-year softness in travel demand, the consensus mark for passenger revenues suggests a 56.1% drop from the number reported in first-quarter 2020. With this anticipated decline in passenger revenues, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues hints at a 52.8% fall from the year-ago reported number.

United Airlines (UAL) announced Monday, in its Q1 earnings report, that it will begin flying this July to Iceland, Greece, and Croatia ""moving to capitalize on emerging pent-up demand for travel to countries where vaccinated travelers are welcome.""   The key, of course, is for a passenger to prove they have been vaccinated. Countries like Israel and China are already using digital certificates to allow citizens to travel while New York state is using The Excelsior Pass. These digital documents allow people to ""present digital proof of COVID-19 vaccination or negative test results."" They are often called vaccine passports but Delta Air Lines (DAL) CEO Ed Bastian told Yahoo Finance Live, ""We don't call it a vaccine passport. It carries too many connotations.""    Vaccine passports have been a political hot potato since the Biden administration proposed in January to merge coronavirus testing documents with vaccination records. Bastian said Delta, like United is, ""more focused on a credential, travel credential, if you will, to indicate that you've been vaccinated and or tested based on the regulatory requirements."" Bastian predicts international passengers will have to prove some form of immunity from the coronavirus which causes COVID-19. ""Either a vaccination or a test,"" he said. ""We're working with a number of technology providers to be able to facilitate that in an open source way.""  ""The challenge with vaccine passports is that it’s one more document that airlines will need to deal with,"" according to airline consultant Mike Boyd, president of Boyd Group International.

2021-04-19T11:10:11.000Z,How Will American Airlines (AAL) Fare This Earnings Season?,"American Airlines AAL is scheduled to report first-quarter 2021 results on Apr 22, before market open.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter loss has widened by approximately 13% in the past 60 days. Moreover, the company has a dull earnings surprise history, having outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the last four quarters and missing estimates in the other two.

Let’s see how things are shaping up for this earnings season. American Airlines Group Inc. price-eps-surprise | American Airlines Group Inc. Quote With increased vaccinations and easing coronavirus-led restrictions, the airline witnessed an uptick in bookings in its domestic markets and short-haul international flights in March. As evidence, American Airlines’ seven-day moving average as of Mar 26 with respect to net bookings was roughly 90% of the level recorded in 2019. This improvement in bookings is likely to reflect on passenger revenues (accounts for bulk of the top line) in the first quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter passenger revenues indicates a 4.9% increase from fourth-quarter 2020’s reported figure. However, with air-travel demand continuing to be weak on a year-over-year basis, the consensus mark for passenger revenues shows a 56.4% decline from the year-ago quarter’s reported number. With travel demand significantly lagging the pre-coronavirus (2019) levels, American Airlines anticipates first-quarter total revenues to decline approximately 62% from first-quarter 2019. Additionally, the company estimates net loss of approximately $1.2 billion-$1.3 billion in the same period.

To match the low-demand scenario, American Airlines reduced its capacity significantly in the first quarter. The airline anticipates system capacity for the March quarter to nosedive 43.4% compared to first-quarter 2019. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total capacity, measured in available seat miles, implies a 39.7% decline from first-quarter 2020’s reported levels.

The reduction in capacity is pushing up non-fuel unit costs (operating cost per available seat mile or CASM, excluding fuel), which in turn might have affected the bottom line. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for adjusted CASM, excluding fuel, suggests a 3.5% rise from the first-quarter 2020 reported figure.

Further, the company’s bottom line is expected to have been hurt by the increase in fuel expenses, thanks to the recent uptick in fuel prices. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for average fuel price per gallon (including related taxes) indicates a 36.2% jump from the sequential quarter’s reported figure. The same hints at a 5.5% decrease from that reported in the first quarter of 2020.     ",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/american-airlines-aal-fare-earnings-111011752.html
2021-04-18T10:32:30.000Z,Boeing's executives under fire as 737 MAX crash victims' families push for change,"Two top Boeing (BA) executives are feeling the heat as families of the victims of the 737 MAX crashes have joined with shareholders to call for high-level reform in the planemaker.  Boeing's annual meeting is set to take place on Tuesday this week, a summit that should give some indication on how it intends to regain its standing in the aerospace sector following repeated safety warnings about one of its key jets as well as the thorny issue of COVID-19-related travel groundings fostering a dip in demand.  Michael Stumo, whose 24-year-old daughter Samya Rose died in the Ethiopian airlines 302 crash, told The Guardian that the board is comprised of ""private equity, celebrity politicians and failed GE cost-cutting people"" that are ""draining its legacy assets.""  He also said Boeing had fired hundreds of engineers, cut corners on quality, and used profits to buy back stock options for executives. The company has already made top-level changes to its board since a second crash shook the company. Seven directors have already left or are due to step down next week.  Board members Larry Kellner and Edmund Giambastiani will be in the crosshairs next week, however, as families and shareholders call for change.  READ MORE: Boeing suffers more electrical issues with 737 MAX The beleaguered manufacturer has had ongoing issues with the safety of its 737 MAX jets.  On Saturday it was reported that an electrical fault that grounded dozens of Boeing 737 MAX jets last week has caused fresh concern after engineers found similar issues elsewhere in the cockpit. Just days ago the aviation company told 16 of its operators that its most-sold model should not be flown until the “production issue” is addressed. It said at the time that it was working alongside the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on the issue, which does not affect its entire fleet. Boeing said it was not related to the flight-control system that suspended its planes previously.

Furthermore, the airline industry and travel industry are set to recover rapidly in 2021, as there is a global vaccination program to put an end to the novel coronavirus pandemic. So is AAL stock a recovery stock pick now? Source: GagliardiPhotography / Shutterstock.com With better days ahead for air travel worldwide, investors may be asking themselves, “Why not grab shares of American Airlines now?” Not so fast. Don’t act without weighing the key risks. Currently, AAL stock faces too many challenges. What is the big picture when assessing whether any particular stock is attractive or not? In the financial analysis, the big picture is the broad economy. And very recently the Fed Chair Jerome Powell made some very important comments about the path of the economic recovery in the U.S. Two of those comments were that “the US economy is about to start growing ‘much more quickly,'” and that “the biggest risk to the economic recovery is another surge in coronavirus cases.” InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips The Fed Chair also mentioned that the U.S. economy is at an “inflection point,” and the economic recovery should continue based on a mix of fiscal and monetary policy and of course due to a massive vaccination program. But the key point to focus on is that he is worried about the event of a resurgence in coronavirus cases. And if we want to be pessimistic, the risk of coronavirus variants may require more than two shots to combat the pandemic completely. This means larger quantities of vaccines will be needed, and the vaccination program will require more time to be completed. Which is bad news for prospects of a full travel recovery and for airlines such as American Airlines. 10 Stocks to Buy for Your $5K Robinhood Portfolio But let us be optimistic.

As the novel coronavirus began spreading its way around the world, American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) stock tumbled badly. Source: GagliardiPhotography / Shutterstock.com At one point, AAL stock was trading hands in single-digit territory, something that wasn’t seen since the aftermath of the Great Recession. Still, what we’ve learned from that economic catastrophe, along with other incredibly disruptive events such as the 9/11 terror attack, is that time eventually heals all wounds. Now, it’s fair to point out that we’re still not out of the woods in terms of the Covid-19 pandemic. Nevertheless, cases are down substantially from their peak, while the vaccine rollout has been very encouraging for previously hard-hit investments like AAL stock. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Indeed, American and its competition, such as United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL) and Delta (NYSE:DAL), is experiencing a much-needed revival. For AAL stock specifically, shares are up nearly 40% on a year-to-date basis. And over the trailing six months, American’s equity unit is up almost 80%. It’s a similar tale for the other majors. Multiple factors support the narrative that the worst is behind AAL stock. Primarily, the economy registered encouraging signs that, while not perfect, is building robust momentum. For instance, the March jobs report obliterated analysts’ expectations, with total nonfarm payroll employment rising by 916,000. With that figure, the unemployment rate is down to 6%. 10 Stocks to Buy for Your $5K Robinhood Portfolio Keep in mind that during the peak of the crisis, unemployment was at 14.8% (in April 2020). The other massive catalyst is consumer sentiment. Not necessarily the index but rather, people are getting over their fears of flying during Covid. According to airport screening data, for the month so far (data up to April 13), passenger volume is down roughly 39% from pre-pandemic levels.

In an interview with Yahoo Finance, CEO Ed Bastian told Yahoo Finance he sees a pathway to profitability even though the airline lost billions. “Our goal will be this summer, which will go from June through Q3 to turn this company profitable and I think we've got a pathway to do that,” Bastian said.

And certainly for the second quarter, we expect to be cash positive yet again,"" he told Yahoo Finance. Still, Delta faces turbulence in the second quarter, predicting its scheduled capacity will be down 32% compared to 2019 and its total revenue will be down 50% to 55%.  Part of that decline is Delta’s decision to continue blocking middle seats through the end of April on all its flights, but Bastian expects passengers to continue booking tickets as confidence grows among Americans receiving the COVID-19 vaccine. “It appears it may still be six or more months out before we start to see international travel starting to pick up and the recovery to corporate business,"" Bastian explained.

2021-04-15T11:43:11.000Z,American Airlines (AAL) Boosts Summer Schedule on Higher Demand,"American Airlines Group AAL is boosting its domestic and international schedules for summer as it is seeing “strong demand.” After being significantly suppressed for the most part of 2020, air-travel demand is improving in 2021 with Americans getting vaccinated and travel restrictions easing.

American Airlines expects its summer domestic capacity to be more than 90% of 2019 level. Meanwhile, international capacity is anticipated to be 80% of summer 2019 level.

On the domestic front, the carrier plans to widen its connectivity to Orlando, FL, offering customers nonstop services from Birmingham, AL; Dayton, OH; Indianapolis, IN and Louisville, KY, among other places. These services will operate on Saturdays, beginning Jun 5. Among other services, the carrier will also launch widebody service from Miami, FL to Los Angeles and New York. American Airlines Group Inc. price | American Airlines Group Inc. Quote  While “international demand has been slower to recover”, American Airlines said that it will continue to offer more flights to several destinations in Latin America and the Caribbean. From Miami, the airline will offer services to Cali, Medellin and Bogota in Colombia; Guayaquil, Ecuador; Lima, Peru; San Juan, Puerto Rico, and some other destinations, this summer. On the whole, the Fort Worth, TX-based company will operate more than 150 new routes this summer.

On Apr 13, American Airlines, carrying a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), provided an investor update, wherein it stated that it had witnessed positive cash burn (on an adjusted basis) in March. This can be linked to the recent uptick in travel demand owing to increased vaccinations and easing coronavirus-led restrictions. Previously, United Airlines UAL, carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), revealed that it generated positive average daily core cash flow in March due to acceleration in customer demand for travel and new bookings in the month.

American and JetBlue launched the first phase of their partnership in February, even as the Justice Department and attorneys general in New York, Massachusetts and other jurisdictions were reviewing the proposed tie-up with codeshares on nearly 80 routes from New York and Boston. The Justice Department is concerned that an American-JetBlue deal could reduce competition at congested Northeast airports in New York and Boston, the WSJ reported, citing people familiar with the matter. Those airports are hubs for U.S. and international travel. The investigation is continuing and no final conclusions have been reached, according to the report. JetBlue said it would defer to the Justice Department to ""provide specifics"" and that its understanding was that the review was ongoing. ""After years of trying, unsuccessfully, to add flying in airports like LaGuardia and Newark, it is clear that the only path for JetBlue to grow is through this alliance,"" the airline said in an emailed statement, adding the alliance will bring lower fares. American Airlines said on Wednesday that it was cooperating with the DOJ's review. The Justice Department was not immediately available for comment. American and JetBlue announced their partnership in July 2020.

Meanwhile, Brazilian carrier Azul AZUL announced dismal traffic data for March as the country experiences a second wave of coronavirus. Another Brazilian airline Gol Linhas’ GOL March traffic also got a huge blow due to the fresh spike in COVID-19 cases as was mentioned in the previous week’s write-up. 1. United Airlines’ management anticipates its first-quarter 2021 revenues to decline 66% from first-quarter 2019 to $3.2 billion due to coronavirus-led suppressed air-travel demand. While the forecast lies in the “favorable end” of the previously guided range of a decrease of 65-70%, it falls short of the current Zacks Consensus Estimate. For the first quarter, United Airlines, currently carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), estimates average daily core cash burn to be approximately $9 million per day.

With continued softness in air-travel demand, thanks to the coronavirus pandemic, the airline anticipates first-quarter total revenues to decline approximately 62% from that reported in the same period in 2019. The carrier’s previous guidance had called for a decrease of 60-65% from the 2019 levels.

Per an investor update, net loss in the same period is estimated to be approximately $1.2 billion-$1.3 billion. Excluding net special credits, the company expects the same to be approximately between $2.7 billion and $2.8 billion. Net loss per share, excluding net special credits, is estimated to be in the range of $4.29-$4.41. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter earnings is pegged at a loss of $3.82.

Previously, the same was predicted to decrease around 45% from first-quarter 2019. Average fuel price (including taxes) per gallon is forecast to be approximately $1.70.

On a positive note, the carrier predicts average daily cash burn for the first quarter to be approximately $27 million per day (includes approximately $9 million per day in regular debt principal and cash severance payments), better than the previous guidance of around $30 million per day. The company stated that it witnessed positive cash burn in March, excluding approximately $8 million per day of regular debt principal and cash severance payments.

2021-04-12T16:17:06.000Z,Texas-based companies speak out against restrictive voting bills: 'Voting is a sacred right',"The confrontation over voting rights between business leaders and political officials is far from over, after Delta (DAL) and Coca-Cola (KO) condemned a controversial Georgia voting law last week amid intense public pressure. Dozens of CEOs from major companies like Pepsi (PEP) and PayPal (PYPL) met on Zoom over the weekend to consider further action against restrictive voting bills introduced in state legislatures nationwide, the Wall Street Journal reported. Meanwhile in Texas, a pair of restrictive voting bills making their way through the legislature put companies in an urgent position over whether to speak out. The corporate uproar over voting rights and ballot access last week was set off by a voting measure in Georgia that critics say disenfranchises Black voters — but only after it became law. In Texas, companies could potentially alter or even stop the legislation. But most of the state’s largest companies — with the exception of American Airlines (AAL) and Dell (DELL) — passed up the opportunity to criticize the restrictive voting bills in response to an inquiry from Yahoo Finance. When Yahoo Finance contacted more than 30 organizations in Texas about the bills, some top businesses like Exxon Mobil (XOM), Southwest Airlines (LUV), and Bumble (BMBL) affirmed their general support for equal and wide access to the ballot box, while many others declined to comment or did not respond. The companies that declined to comment include Sysco (SYY), Halliburton (HAL), the Houston Rockets, and the Dallas Mavericks. Companies in Texas face competing interests as they weigh whether to take public positions on the state’s voting bills. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, a Republican who supports the bills, made headlines last week after declining an invitation to throw out the first pitch at the Texas Rangers home opener, citing Major League Baseball’s decision to move its All-Star game out of Georgia in protest of the state’s restrictive voting law.

Bulls want to see the stock react to the inverted head-and-shoulder pattern and break up above the descending trendline. If American Airlines’ stock can break above the descending trendline, it has room to fill the gap and trade in the $27 range, which is in line with its pre-pandemic share prices.

Bulls want to see Royal Caribbean’s stock react to the inverted head-and-shoulder pattern and jump up to fill the overhead gap around $105.

2021-04-09T14:35:28.000Z,Two big trends to watch closely in the months ahead: Morning Brief,"Yahoo Finance’s Myles Udland, Brian Sozzi, and Julie Hyman discuss eye-popping data in the coming months amid economic recovery. MYLES UDLAND: We begin this hour with the latest Yahoo Finance morning brief. And looking at a couple of charts that come to us courtesy of the team over at Bank of America Global Research, they, of course, like JP Morgan, kind of bring together all of the car data that they have within their system. And take a look at what they think the con-- what they know, I should say, the consumer is doing, and therefore what we might see in some official data. Next week, we are set to get the March reading on retail sales. B of A right now looking for an 11.1% increase in a month on month sales based on their data. But in the brief today, we looked at a couple of specific sectors of the economy and how spending has changed, both compared to last year and over the last two years. The first is airlines, where we have seen spending, as you would expect, up several hundred percentage points, literally off the chart here you can see compared to last year. But notably, last year at this time, airline spending was down more than 100%. How is that even possible, you might ask. Well, not only was no one booking any airline travel, refunds were outpacing any new money that was being spent on airlines. Airbnb actually had a similar situation for a couple of weeks really right in the teeth of the pandemic. And so, that's why the one-year number has been so flat, about several hundred percent. But as we see in the light blue line here, over the last two years, airline spending is still negative. And so we're still below that pre-pandemic trend. And really how quickly we get back there, if indeed, we get back here, I think will be a very simple and clean way to gauge the reopening. Another one of the charts in this presentation that caught my attention is what's happening at home furnishing stores. We saw, again, because of the distortion, the distorted effects of COVID, you see the huge decline over on the left-hand side as the pandemic hit, but then as we know, people started investing in their homes, several percentage points higher right now compared to a year ago. But the light blue line shows us that over the last two years, home furnishing spending is still materially higher.    ",https://finance.yahoo.com/video/two-big-trends-watch-closely-143528206.html

We believe hedge fund sentiment should serve as a crucial tool of an individual investor’s stock selection process, as it may offer great insights of how the brightest minds of the finance industry feel about specific stocks. After all, these people have access to smartest analysts and expensive data/information sources that individual investors can't match. So should one consider investing in American Airlines Group Inc (NASDAQ:AAL)? The smart money sentiment can provide an answer to this question. Is AAL stock a buy? American Airlines Group Inc (NASDAQ:AAL) shares haven't seen a lot of action during the second quarter. Overall, hedge fund sentiment was unchanged. The stock was in 37 hedge funds' portfolios at the end of the fourth quarter of 2020. Our calculations also showed that AAL isn't among the 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds (click for Q4 rankings). The level and the change in hedge fund popularity aren't the only variables you need to analyze to decipher hedge funds' perspectives. A stock may witness a boost in popularity but it may still be less popular than similarly priced stocks.

However, with the vaccines rolling out, AAL stock is getting an outsized reaction, as are its peers. Source: GagliardiPhotography / Shutterstock.com The airline industry has been hobbled by the effects of the novel coronavirus pandemic. It will not bounce back with nearly as much vigor as people seem to think. The reality is AAL stock is overvalued, factoring in its massive debt load and the industry’s cut-throat competition. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips AAL stock has been rallying in the past three months, and is up more than 57% year-to-date. Investor interest in recovery plays and the industry’s optimism with the approval of the vaccine are pushing airline stocks higher. 7 Micro-Cap Stocks to Buy That Are Shining Right Now This is strange considering how AAL stock now trades higher than its price just before the pandemic. Travel numbers are expected to pick up in the third and fourth quarters, but it will take a long time before they return to pre-pandemic levels. Therefore, AAL stock’s price results from the market’s overreaction, which further reduces its attractiveness to investors at this time. The pandemic exacerbated American’s debt problem to the point where shareholders were concerned about its solvency. Despite its best efforts, the company’s net debt stands at roughly $30 billion. It is paying more than a billion dollars in debt servicing, which is likely to have crippling long-term effects on its operations. In all fairness, it has done well to reduce its cash burn, which went as high as $100 million per day last year. However, its cash burn now averages $30 million per day, which amounts to almost a staggering $11 billion a year. The federal government’s support through the CARES Act has been nothing short of a blessing. It provided payroll grants which covered the bulk of airline labor costs from April to September of 2020.

The airline stocks, of course, have been boosted by the re-opening trade. But is AAL stock a good choice right now for investors? Or is it better to wait before taking a positive position in the name? Let’s take a look. The outlook of air travel is definitely promising right now. With the aggressive rollout of the vaccines for the novel coronavirus from companies like Pfizer (NYSE:PFE), Moderna (NASDAQ:MRNA) and Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), it does look like the U.S. will get back to normal soon. 7 Cheap Stocks with Growing Tailwinds In the meantime, there is considerable pent-up demand for travel. Keep in mind that Americans are already traveling more. According to the latest figures, during a recent week, domestic daily air traffic averaged 1.2 million per day. That is the highest level since the beginning of the pandemic. What’s more, Congress recently approved $1.9 trillion of stimulus for the U.S. economy. That spending should also promote strong demand for travel in the coming months. The pandemic triggered a near-death experience for American Airlines. Without the government’s support, the company may have gone bust and the owners of AAL stock would have lost most of their investments. But the pandemic had some silver linings for the airlines. Its operations have become much more streamlined because of the heavy cost cutting and efficiency efforts that it undertook. So as its revenues start to climb, it should benefit from considerable operating leverage.              ",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/american-airlines-stock-may-lose-160609939.html

""We are strongly opposed to this bill and others like it,"" Fort Worth, Texas-based American said in a statement. The legislation, which is now set to go before the Texas House of Representatives, would eliminate drive-through voting, limit polling site hours and give partisan poll watchers more autonomy. Southwest Airlines, also based in Texas, declined to say if it opposed the legislation but said: ""We believe every voter should have a fair opportunity to let their voice be heard. This right is essential to our nation’s success."" The Texas effort drew sharp criticism from voting rights advocates and Democrats in the state, who argue that the legislation would make it more difficult for Texans, particularly those of color, to cast ballots. The state already has some of the most stringent voting laws in the country, according to election experts. A state House of Representatives committee on Thursday was holding a hearing on a companion bill that would impose other voting restrictions. Texas is one of several states, including Georgia, Florida, Arizona and Iowa, where Republican lawmakers have pursued new voting limits after former President Donald Trump falsely blamed his November loss on widespread voter fraud despite no evidence. Republican lawmakers say the law is needed to ensure public confidence in election integrity. The comments by American and Southwest came after Atlanta-based Delta Air Lines and Coca-Cola on Wednesday joined a growing number of companies that challenged the state of Georgia's new voting restrictions. Delta CEO Ed Bastian blasted the law on Wednesday in a reversal from an initial statement last week that sparked a popular backlash.

KRISTIN MYERS: People are traveling again. According to the TSA screening figures, almost 1.3 million people flew just yesterday. And as you guys can see there from that chart, just a few days ago on March 28, we saw almost a pandemic high of nearly 1.6 million people being screened by the TSA. And even more people will be able to cram onto those planes when Delta adds that middle seat back on May 1. So let's talk more about travel with Brian Kelly, founder and CEO of The Points Guy. So Brian, we're seeing more and more people traveling. When do you think we'll get back to those pre-pandemic levels? Will it happen any time soon? BRIAN KELLY: Well, you know, we're closing in about 60% of pre-pandemic levels, which is, frankly, shocking to me, considering almost all international travel to Europe and Asia is cut off. But we won't really get back to those full numbers until business travel rebounds and in talking to a lot of companies, you know, those old days of road warriors, it's going to take a while to come back to people are comfortable from that. And many are predicting they won't come back at all. Business travel will look completely different. So a lot of open question marks, but the numbers keep rising week over week. ALEXIS CHRISTOFOROUS: That is for sure, Brian. And I know leisure travel is really taking off. Look, there's a lot of pent-up demand, right? We've all been inside, not being able to go anywhere for the past year plus. So people are trying to get out and about. And I'm wondering about where people are flying right now. What are some of the hot spots? And I know prices are insane because of all the demand. Are there places where people can still get some good, you know, airline deals and also some good hotel deals? BRIAN KELLY: Yeah, so I mean, Florida-- I was in Miami Beach last week. Absolutely packed-- you would never even know that there was a pandemic there. Definitely Puerto Rico as well, because you don't have to get tested to come back into the country since it's a US territory. But we're still seeing big numbers in Mexico and Caribbean. But we are hearing from travelers. People are not comfortable yet traveling far distances internationally, especially now with new lockdowns just announced in France and Italy.

2021-04-01T16:19:04.000Z,Will U.S. Airlines' Expansion Spree Boost Summer Trips?,"After being ravaged by the coronavirus-led declining demand for air travel, things are looking up for the U.S. airlines this year. With the gradual reopening of the economy, economic activities are picking up. The upbeat reading on U.S. consumer optimism in March highlights this improving scenario. On Mar 30, 2021, the Conference Board reported that Consumer Confidence in March jumped to a one-year high of 109.7 from the downwardly revised 90.4 in February. The above buoyant scenario naturally translated into increased air-travel demand. The increasing number of people getting vaccinated by the day also bodes well. Highlighting this rosy scenario, the NYSE ARCA Airline Index has gained a massive 106.6% so far this year. With air-travel demand gradually bettering in the United States (particularly on the leisure front), U.S. carriers unfurled bullish projections. Evidently, American Airlines’ AAL management stated that bookings (with respect to the domestic markets and short-haul international flights) recently improved. Reflective of this uptick, the seven-day moving average as of Mar 26 regarding the net bookings at the currently Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) American Airlines was roughly 90% of the level recorded in 2019. Moreover, the reading related to domestic load factor (% of seats filled by passengers) was nearly 80% in the period, further mirroring the recovery in air-travel demand. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here. Highlighting the uptrend in booking trends, management of this Fort Worth, TX based carrier stated that it now expects system capacity (measured in available seat miles) for the March quarter to decline nearly in the 40-45% band from the levels achieved in first-quarter 2019. Earlier, the expectation was a decline of 45% for capacity from the first-quarter 2019 reading. American Airlines apart, other U.S. airline heavyweights like United Airlines UAL and Southwest Airlines LUV provided bright projections for the March quarter of 2021. Per Ankit Gupta, vice president of United Airlines’ domestic network planning and scheduling, the airline has seen the “strongest flight bookings since the start of the pandemic” over the past few weeks.

Alaska Airlines’ CEO, Ben Minicucci, said, “Joining oneworld is joining a family of the best airlines in the world.” Minicucci further added, “Being a part of the alliance allows us to provide fantastic global connectivity, a seamless travel experience and more valuable loyalty offerings for our guests.”

As part of oneworld, Alaska Airlines will be able to strengthen its global network to cover as many as 1,000 destinations across more than 170 countries and territories. With this membership, the carrier will add seven new airline partners and enhance its existing partnerships with six oneworld members. Alaska Air Group, Inc. price | Alaska Air Group, Inc. Quote With air-travel continuing to recover as more people get vaccinated, Alaska Airlines’ joining of the oneworld alliance could not have come at a better time.

Apart from a wider network, the membership brings into focus Alaska Airlines’ closer ties with its long-standing partner and oneworld founding member, American Airlines AAL. The two airlines have been partners for nearly 40 years. On Alaska Airlines’ oneworld membership, American Airlines’ president, Robert Isom, stated, “By connecting American's strength in long-haul international flying and Alaska's strong presence along the West Coast, we're building a better network for our customers than either airline could build alone.”

With this membership, Alaska Airlines customers who are members of Alaska Mileage Plan can now earn miles when they travel on any of the other 13 members, which include American Airlines, British Airways, Cathay Pacific Airways and Qatar Airways, among others. Mileage redemption on airlines with which Alaska Airlines did not have previous partnerships, will begin in the coming months.

Additionally, the airline’s elite Mileage Plan members will enjoy privileges such as access to more than 650 international first and business class lounges, and priority check-in and boarding.

He told Yahoo Finance Live that by the end of the summer the airlines could be flying at financially sustainable levels. ""That would be in, we're hoping, the 60% to 65% range,"" he said.

""U.S. airline trends appear encouraging as the bookings recovery (early March through present) is the strongest it has been so far in the pandemic at 70%-80% of 2019 levels,"" Raymond James analyst Savanthi Syth told clients in her most recent note. Syth said average round-trip U.S. domestic fares for May to August have increased, but are still 20% lower than comparable fares in 2019. ""We believe JetBlue (JBLU), Spirit (SAVE), and, to a lesser extent, United Airlines (UAL) have the most favorable near term fare trends and, thus, revenue recovery trends.

He is the president and CEO of Hawaiian Airlines. And Peter, while high and tight might refer to a military haircut, I think it also refers to the fact that your team runs a tight ship with Hawaiian and you are flying high right now, you're doing very well. You just started selling tickets nonstop from Phoenix to Maui. And I read an interview in which you said you expect to be flying 60% to 70% full as more planes are taking to the air. Why the optimism? PETER INGRAM: Well, we've seen a good uptick in bookings over the last couple of months really. Since the end of January our domestic US bookings have really started to accelerate. And as we are finishing the month of March we'll end up with a load factor in the 60s during the month of March. We think we've got an opportunity to better that in April. We're starting to see people optimistic about booking out into later in the second quarter and even into the third quarter. So as vaccinations are rolling out, the pent up demand for travel is really manifesting itself. ADAM SHAPIRO: We hear about this pent up demand in travel. We had on Nick Calio from Airlines for America talking about this, Mike Boyd the airline consultant talking about this. In regards to Hawaiian, I think in the previous interview with you, was it 30% of pre-pandemic traffic was actually coming from Japan. Help us understand how important the Japanese passenger is and when that person might be coming back aboard Hawaiian Airlines aircraft. PETER INGRAM: For our airline, international prior to the pandemic represented about 25% of our revenue. And the biggest piece of that, more than half of that, is from Japan. And Japan represented about a million and a half visitors for Hawaii overall. So a really substantial part of our traditional visitor base here.

And while search traffic has increased for the airlines, Kapur said the data for the top searched cities and states Utah, Miami, Montana, is also increasing.  ""National parks have always been pretty heavily searched,"" said Kapur.   But she suspects the pandemic has changed the way people think about where to go on vacation. ""I don't think that people really want to go to a crowded location for a while until they feel that it is truly safe.

The top five searched vacation destinations right now are Yellowstone National Park, Disney World, North Carolina's Outer Banks, Las Vegas and Disneyland.   The one international destination that makes the top 10 was Bora Bora in French Polynesia.

And people clearly want to travel. We're encouraged by the vaccinations. Fares are lower. But remember, what-- before the pandemic started fares were at historic lows. And as demand increases, we assume the prices will increase. Also right now, bookings are looking a little better, but a lot of people are booking with tickets that they had for last-- for flights last year, and the time to use those tickets were extended.

In a SEC filing, management of this Fort Worth, TX based carrier stated that it now expects system capacity (measured in available seat miles) for the March quarter to decline roughly in the 40-45% band from the levels achieved in first-quarter 2019. Earlier, the expectation was a decline of 45% for capacity from the first-quarter 2019 reading. Management, however, refrained from issuing capacity guidance for the June quarter. On another positive note, management stated that bookings (with respect to domestic markets and short-haul international flights) recently improved. Notably, bookings were hampered in the early part of the March quarter of 2021 due to the order imposed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention pertaining to the requirement of testing negative for COVID-19 to qualify for an entry into the United States Reflective of this betterment, the seven-day moving average as of Mar 26 with respect to the net bookings at the currently Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) American Airlines, was roughly 90% of the level recorded in 2019. Moreover, the reading related to domestic load factor (% of seats filled by passengers) was nearly 80% in the period, further mirroring the recovery in air-travel demand.

Expecting the sunnier scenario to continue into the summer season, United Airlines UAL and Southwest Airlines LUV look forward to boost their respective domestic networks to meet the anticipated demand swell in the hotter months. Notably, Alaska Air Group’s ALK subsidiary Alaska Airlines also recently announced its plan to bolster its domestic network in a bid to meet the anticipated surge in air-travel demand during summer. This was mentioned in detail in the previous week’s writeup. 1.

2021-03-30T15:31:28.000Z,American Airlines Says Domestic And Short-Haul International Bookings Have Picked Up Recently,"American Airlines Group Inc. announced an operational update of its business. Pandemic-related regulations imposed on entry into the US at the beginning of 2021 did impact American Airlines’ (AAL) bookings at the beginning of the first quarter. However, on a significant decline in infection and hospitalization rates along with a rise in vaccine distribution during 1Q, the company recently has witnessed strength in domestic and short-haul international bookings. As of March 26, American Airlines’ statistics reflect a seven-day moving average of net bookings at 90% of the level experienced in 2019, with a domestic load factor of 80%. The company expects strong bookings to continue through the end of the first quarter and into the second quarter. American Airlines anticipates system capacity (total available seat miles) for the first quarter of 2021 to decline about 40%-45% year-over-year, compared to the prior guidance of a decline of 45%. Being cautious in the current uncertain demand environment, American Airlines will continue to monitor demand and adjust fleet and capacity, as deemed necessary, on an ongoing basis. At present, the company plans to reactivate most of its aircraft in the second quarter to meet expected demand. (See American Airlines stock analysis on TipRanks) Following the update, Citigroup analyst Stephen Trent maintained a Sell rating on the stock, based on the “cautious view” on American Airlines’ expected capacity additions and its comments on the seven-day moving average bookings improving to 90% of pre-pandemic levels. The rest of the Street is bearish about the stock with a Moderate Sell consensus rating. That’s based on 2 Buys, 5 Holds, and 6 Sells. The average analyst price target of $18.89 implies 17.6% downside potential to current levels. American Airlines gets a 3 out of 10 on TipRanks’ Smart Score ranking, suggesting that it is likely to underperform market expectations. Related News:

2021-03-30T10:00:52.000Z,There are signs that America's airline industry is bouncing back,"America's travelers continue to book flights for post-pandemic vacations in a sign U.S. airlines are ready for takeoff, according to aviation consultant Mike Boyd. ""When you look at what they're doing, I'm very confident that they're going to get through this now. They're going to have to grow back, but they're going to get through this,"" he told Yahoo Finance Live, while cautioning that passengers may still be wary of traveling to locked-down locations. ""They've been afraid to get to New York City and find out it's under quarantine, or LA is shut down, or things like that. When we get more confidence in the destination we're going to see more people flying. But right now, no one wants to fly to a place where they can't buy a hamburger,"" said Boyd, the president of Boyd Group International, which provides analysis for airports and aviation businesses. The data backs up Boyd's contention that the airline industry is recovering. According to the Transportation Security Administration, more than 1 million people passed each day through the nation's airports between March 11 and March 28. By March 28, that number was over 1.5 million. During that same period in 2020, the number fell from 1.7 million to 184,000, as the coronavirus shuttered much of the nation's economy. Of course, that's lower than numbers in 2019, when the daily number of passengers fluctuated between 2.1 million and 2.6 million. Analysts are still encouraged by the numbers, though. ""U.S. airline trends appear encouraging as the bookings recovery (early March through present) is the strongest it has been so far in the pandemic at 70-80% of 2019 levels,"" Raymond James Analyst Savanthi Syth told clients in her most recent note. While U.S. domestic fares remain up to 20% lower than comparable fares in 2019, Syth pointed out that the average round-trip U.S. domestic fares for May to August have increased.

2021-03-29T20:01:52.000Z,'More confidence in the destination' will lead to more flights: Airline expert on travel amid COVID-19,"Boyd Group International President Michael Boyd joins the Yahoo Finance Live panel to discuss air travel pickup amid the COVID-19 pandemic. ADAM SHAPIRO: So let's talk more about where the airlines are headed. We have a special we want to tell you about. It's called Ready for Takeoff. Let's roll the graphic and invite in Michael Boyd, president of Boyd Group International. It's good to see you, Mike. Thank you for being here. I want to ask you, are the airlines ready for takeoff? How would you describe it? MICHAEL BOYD: I don't think the airline industry has ever been as well managed as it is today. So yeah, they're ready. Every airline is different. Every airline strategy is different. When you look at what they're doing, I'm very confident that, you know, they're going to get through this. Now, they're going to have to grow back, but they're going to get through this. SEANA SMITH: Hey, Michael, when you take a look at all the airlines right now from your view, from everything-- all the work that you've done digging into these names, which one is best positioned right now? MICHAEL BOYD: Well, that's a hard call because they're all very different. Look at what Southwest has done. United Airlines is trying some very innovative route strategies. So is Spirit. So I would say, I can't pick one out. I'm saying, is, we have a very strong airline industry today. But if I had to pick any of them, you know, yet, Delta, United, and American and Southwest, they're all running head to head. ADAM SHAPIRO: When you look at the airlines, though, it's all about the volume of passengers and their capacity. And we're still flying. I mean, yesterday's throughput from TSA, Mike, was 1.5 plus million. In 2019, it would have been around 2.4 million. We still got one million passengers to get back on planes. What is that telling you? MICHAEL BOYD: Well, we're going to end up this year by our forecast about at 605 million in plane passengers. That's down from over $900 million in 2019, so they're going to grow back. But keep in mind, airlines are growing back very differently. They have a different strategy. You know, they're going to put only the capacity they think they can sell. And I think it's going to be one of those issues where it's going to be a slow growth back to 2019 levels, which represents a lot of problems for suppliers and whatnot. But the airline industry is going to be able to get through that. But we're not going to have the same size or scope of the airline industry that we thought we were going to have a year ago.
